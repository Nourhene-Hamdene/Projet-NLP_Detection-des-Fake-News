Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\n\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\n\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\n\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\n\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\n\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\n\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\n\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.  \n",

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\n\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing.

He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\n\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\n\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\n\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\n\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\n\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base.

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\n\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, \"Free the Burger,\" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression.

Previously, Apple Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said the Watch would release in Spring 2015.\n",

them kill her son in an ambush. Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven-hour gunbattle in Farah province.\\n\\nGul, who was joined by her daughter and daughter in-law, engaged the Taliban using AK-47s and grenades, despitenever before having used a weapon.\\n\\nThe embattled mother told Tolo news, a 24-hour Afghan news broadcaster, she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed, Gul and the other two women fought back.\\n\\n“I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,” Gul told Tolo News. “I went to the check post and began shooting back.”\\n\\nSeema, her daughter-in-law, added: “The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.”\\n\\nGul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.\\n\\nWhile the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.\\n\\nTaliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.\\n\\nWhile the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.\\n\\nThat particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country’s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai.  \n",

(Brian) Sandoval and other legislators in Carson City at 4 p.m. tomorrow to announce a major economic development,\" a Tesla rep told Business Insider.\\n\\nThe Gigafactory is a critical piece of CEO Elon Musk's plan to make a mass-market Tesla car, and lower the cost of carbon-neutral power. Musk has said he intends to double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries by 2020 and thus drive the price of the power packs downward. He's also said he plans to build multiple Gigafactories in the future.\\n\\nTesla had already broken ground on a prospective site outside Reno earlier this summer that only bore the name \"Project Tiger.\" The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center currently boasts e-commerce facilities owned by Apple, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Zulily.\\n\\nTesla's facility, which is expected to employ 6,500 workers is estimated to cost up to $5 billion. CNBC says specific terms of the deal with the state are still being worked out, and that it could be a week before they're announced.\\n\\nDow Jones also reported Nevada was chosen.  \n",

said to be in development as a replacement for the entry-level iPhone 5c.\\n\\nThe handset will be launched during 2015, according to Chinese rumour site Feng.com, although there it's unknown if the new model would be a scaled-down luxury phone or continue to act as the entry-level iPhone to Apple's range.\\n\\nIf true, the move would be a return to creating smaller handsets following the runaway success of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, launched in September.\\n\\niPhones now account of 39.5 per cent of British smartphone sales, the Californian company's highest ever UK market share, thanks to strong sales of the new models. The smaller 6 outsold the 6 Plus by 4:1 across the UK, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.\\n\\nThe two new handsets swiftly became Apple's fastest-selling product to date, shifting more than 10 million units within three days. A return to manufacturing 4-inch handsets (the size of the current iPhone 5s and 5c models) would extend the iPhone 6 design across three differently sized phones.\\n\\nConsumers are unlikely to see the launch of a new iPhone before September 2015, although the company's first smartwatch the Apple Watch is due for release in the spring.  \n",
              "4  GR editor’s Note\\n\\nThere are no reports in the Western mainstream media pertaining to this issue.\\n\\nThis report is based on statements emanating from the Iraq parliament, with photographic evidence. We have not been in a position to corroborate this report by FARS  News.\\n\\n*     *     *\\n\\nIraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\\n\\n“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\\n\\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\\n\\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\\n\\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\\n\\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\\n\\n“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\\n\\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\\n\\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\\n\\nAl-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.\\n\\n“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.\\n\\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\\n\\n“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\\n\\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”\\n\\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.\\n\\n“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\\n\\nHe said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”\\n\\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\\n\\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\\n\\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.\\n\\nGharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”\\n\\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.\\n\\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\\n\\n“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\\n\\n“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.\\n\\nHababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\\n\\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\\n\\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\\n\\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\\n\\n“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\\n\\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\\n\\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\\n\\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\\n\\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.

Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven-hour gunbattle in Farah province.\\n\\nGul, who was joined by her daughter and daughter in-law, engaged the Taliban using AK-47s and grenades, despitenever before having used a weapon.\\n\\nThe embattled mother told Tolo news, a 24-hour Afghan news broadcaster, she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed, Gul and the other two women fought back.\\n\\n“I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,” Gul told Tolo News. “I went to the check post and began shooting back.”\\n\\nSeema, her daughter-in-law, added: “The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.”\\n\\nGul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.\\n\\nWhile the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.\\n\\nTaliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.\\n\\nWhile the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.\\n\\nThat particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country’s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai.</td>\n",

The smaller 6 outsold the 6 Plus by 4:1 across the UK, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.\\n\\nThe two new handsets swiftly became Apple's fastest-selling product to date, shifting more than 10 million units within three days. A return to manufacturing 4-inch handsets (the size of the current iPhone 5s and 5c models) would extend the iPhone 6 design across three differently sized phones.\\n\\nConsumers are unlikely to see the launch of a new iPhone before September 2015, although the company's first smartwatch the Apple Watch is due for release in the spring.</td>\n",

              "      <td>GR editor’s Note\\n\\nThere are no reports in the Western mainstream media pertaining to this issue.\\n\\nThis report is based on statements emanating from the Iraq parliament, with photographic evidence. We have not been in a position to corroborate this report by FARS  News.\\n\\n*     *     *\\n\\nIraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\\n\\n“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\\n\\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\\n\\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\\n\\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\\n\\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\\n\\n“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\\n\\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\\n\\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\\n\\nAl-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.\\n\\n“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.\\n\\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\\n\\n“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\\n\\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”\\n\\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.\\n\\n“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\\n\\nHe said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”\\n\\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\\n\\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\\n\\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.\\n\\nGharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”\\n\\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.\\n\\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\\n\\n“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\\n\\n“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.\\n\\nHababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\\n\\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\\n\\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\\n\\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\\n\\n“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\\n\\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\\n\\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\\n\\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\\n\\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.</td>\n",

Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\n\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\n\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\n\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\n\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\n\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\n\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\n\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.   \n",

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\n\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, \"Free the Burger,\" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000. Here's why Mickey D's food seemingly never decays.)   \n",
              "3  Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.\\n\\nTwitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.\\n\\nPhotos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\n\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\n\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.\\n\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\n\\n— \\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\n\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\n\\n“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”\\n\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.\\n\\n“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\n\\n“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.\\n\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.   \n",

The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.\\n\\nA member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”\\n\\nSeparately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.\\n\\nTada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.\\n\\n“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.\\n\\n“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain.

              "      <td>A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\n\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\n\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\n\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\n\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\n\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\n\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\n\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.</td>\n",

              "      <td>(NEWSER) – Wonder how long a Quarter Pounder with cheese can last? Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\n\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing.

British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\n\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\n\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.\\n\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\n\\n— \\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\n\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\n\\n“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”\\n\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.\\n\\n“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\n\\n“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.\\n\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.</td>\n",

The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.\\n\\nA member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”\\n\\nSeparately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.\\n\\nTada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.\\n\\n“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.\\n\\n“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain.
