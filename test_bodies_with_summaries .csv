2,"A bereaved Afghan mother took revenge on the Taliban after watching them kill her son in an ambush. Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven-hour gunbattle in Farah province.

Gul, who was joined by her daughter and daughter in-law, engaged the Taliban using AK-47s and grenades, despitenever before having used a weapon.

The embattled mother told Tolo news, a 24-hour Afghan news broadcaster, she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed, Gul and the other two women fought back.

“I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,” Gul told Tolo News. “I went to the check post and began shooting back.”

Seema, her daughter-in-law, added: “The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.”

Gul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.

While the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.

Taliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.

While the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

That particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country’s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai.",bereaved afghan mother took revenge taliban watching kill son ambush reza gul killed taliban fighter injured five others seven hour gunbattle farah province gul joined daughter daughter law engaged taliban using ak grenade despitenever used weapon embattled mother told tolo news hour afghan news broadcaster awakened shot early tuesday seeing son killed gul two woman fought back stop picked weapon gul told tolo news went check post began shooting back seema daughter law added fighting intensified reached battlefield along light heavy weapon committed fight last bullet gul said battlefield covered talib fighter deadly exchange ended taliban publicly commented incident afghan government labeled symbol public uprising taliban taliban group regained large swathe country u nato force slowly pull troop year war taliban targeted government foreign infrastructure group attempt claw back power lost taliban made key gain rural region member continue employ suicide bomber tactic well protected town city earlier week people killed suicide bomber detonated vest volleyball competition yahyakahil paktika province particular attack prompted president ashraf ghani order complete overview country defense force rethink ban nighttime raid outlawed predecessor hamid karzai,afghan mother took revenge taliban watching kill son ambush reza gul killed taliban fighter injured five others seven hour gunbattle farah province gul joined daughter daughter law engaged taliban using ak grenade despitenever used weapon embattled mother told tolo news went check post began shooting back seema daughter law added fighting intensified reached battlefield along light heavy weapon committed fight last bullet gul said battlefield covered talib fighter deadly exchange ended
3,"CNBC is reporting Tesla has chosen Nevada as the site of its Gigafactory.

""We look forward to meeting with Gov. (Brian) Sandoval and other legislators in Carson City at 4 p.m. tomorrow to announce a major economic development,"" a Tesla rep told Business Insider.

The Gigafactory is a critical piece of CEO Elon Musk's plan to make a mass-market Tesla car, and lower the cost of carbon-neutral power. Musk has said he intends to double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries by 2020 and thus drive the price of the power packs downward. He's also said he plans to build multiple Gigafactories in the future.

Tesla had already broken ground on a prospective site outside Reno earlier this summer that only bore the name ""Project Tiger."" The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center currently boasts e-commerce facilities owned by Apple, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Zulily.

Tesla's facility, which is expected to employ 6,500 workers is estimated to cost up to $5 billion. CNBC says specific terms of the deal with the state are still being worked out, and that it could be a week before they're announced.

12,"A 4-inch version of the iPhone 6 is said to be in development as a replacement for the entry-level iPhone 5c.

The handset will be launched during 2015, according to Chinese rumour site Feng.com, although there it's unknown if the new model would be a scaled-down luxury phone or continue to act as the entry-level iPhone to Apple's range.

If true, the move would be a return to creating smaller handsets following the runaway success of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, launched in September.

iPhones now account of 39.5 per cent of British smartphone sales, the Californian company's highest ever UK market share, thanks to strong sales of the new models. The smaller 6 outsold the 6 Plus by 4:1 across the UK, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.

The two new handsets swiftly became Apple's fastest-selling product to date, shifting more than 10 million units within three days. A return to manufacturing 4-inch handsets (the size of the current iPhone 5s and 5c models) would extend the iPhone 6 design across three differently sized phones.

Consumers are unlikely to see the launch of a new iPhone before September 2015, although the company's first smartwatch the Apple Watch is due for release in the spring.",inch version iphone said development replacement entry level iphone c handset launched according chinese rumour site feng com although unknown new model would scaled luxury phone continue act entry level iphone apple range true move would return creating smaller handset following runaway success inch iphone inch iphone plus launched september iphones account per cent british smartphone sale californian company highest ever uk market share thanks strong sale new model smaller outsold plus across uk according kantar worldpanel comtech two new handset swiftly became apple fastest selling product date shifting million unit within three day return manufacturing inch handset size current iphone c model would extend iphone design across three differently sized phone consumer unlikely see launch new iphone september although company first smartwatch apple watch due release spring,said development replacement entry level iphone c handset launched according to chinese rumour site feng com . unknown new model would scale iphone apple range true move would return creating smaller handset following runaway success inch iphone inch iphone plus launched september iphones account per cent british smartphone sale californian company highest ever uk market share .

There are no reports in the Western mainstream media pertaining to this issue.

This report is based on statements emanating from the Iraq parliament, with photographic evidence. We have not been in a position to corroborate this report by FARS  News.

Iraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.

Hababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.",gr editor note report western mainstream medium pertaining issue report based statement emanating iraq parliament photographic evidence position corroborate report far news iraq army

It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn’t turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country),” Reddit user lerde writes.

“Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she’d received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections,” lerde writes. “The next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.”

21,"Absolutely no one was devastated when news broke last week that 26-year-old Afton Elaine “Star” Burton would not be marrying 80-year-old psychopath felon Charles Manson after all. But as it turns out, there’s more to the story than their wedding license expiring.

Just in case you needed more nightmare fuel... ((AP Photos/California Department of Corrections)
Just in case you needed more nightmare fuel… ((AP Photos/California Department of Corrections)
The New York Post is reporting that journalist Daniel Simone learned the true reason behind the nixed nuptials: Manson’s fiancee was marrying him to get access to his corpse.

According to Simone, Star isn’t quite the deranged Manson maniac we all thought she was. She was a woman with a plan. Not a good plan, necessarily. But a plan.

When Manson keeled over, Star reportedly envisioned putting the murderous cult leader on display Lenin-style in a glass coffin so she could charge money to morbid looky-loos.

Manson was allegedly less-than-pleased with this idea and called off the unholy prison wedding — potentially the only good thing he’s ever done his life. The Post has all the details, including this masterpiece of insanity:

Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. “He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

Manson is housed in California State Prison, Corcoran and is presumably now looking for a life partner who is not interested in profiting off his disgusting corpse.

28,"In designing its first wearable device in the Apple Watch, Apple looked to incorporate a variety of highly advanced health functions with an eye on creating a holistic monitoring device, but ultimately scrapped those plans due to technological and regulatory hurdles.

According to The Wall Street Journal, sources claim Apple Watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in April. Specifically, Apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool, one capable of measuring a user's blood pressure, heart rate, stress level and more, said people familiar with the matter.

The publication says the setbacks forced Apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer. As it stands, Apple Watch boasts a variety of sensors, including accelerometers, touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor, the latter of which connects to the iOS Health app for fitness and wellness tracking. While polished and presented in a slick package, Apple Watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of Android.

Aside from catchall smartwatch devices, a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products — usually wrist-worn — from smaller manufacturers and startups. For example, the W/Me band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels, while the latest products from Fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring.

Apple started development of its Watch four years ago, with an eye on health and fitness, but the project was quickly dubbed a ""black hole"" for sucking in resources. Advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet Apple's rigorous standards, sources said.

For example, skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs, but later testing showed actual results varied person to person, with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings. The company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features, but results were inconsistent.

Apple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs, as evidenced by recently discovered job postings, but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation Watch. Instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness, the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory, iOS compatible smartwatch, iPhone companion and daily communicator, among others.

Apple Watch does, however, sport a few Apple-only features, including Apple Pay integration and WatchKit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year.",designing first wearable device apple watch apple looked incorporate variety highly advanced health function eye creating holistic monitoring device ultimately scrapped plan due technological regulatory hurdle according wall street journal source claim apple watch supposed much device unveiled last year slated launch april specifically apple executive wanted produce cutting edge health monitoring tool one capable measuring user blood pressure heart rate stress level said people familiar matter publication say setback forced apple executive corner came marketing device general consumer stand apple watch boast variety sensor including accelerometer touch input bespoke optical heart rate sensor latter connects io health app fitness wellness tracking polished presented slick package apple watch powered technology par competing device running flavor android aside catchall smartwatch device number standalone solution shelf medical style monitoring already exist form product usually wrist worn smaller manufacturer startup example w band incorporates specialized sensor measure user autonomic nervous system keeping track stress level latest product fitbit tout day heart rate monitoring apple started development watch four year ago eye health fitness project quickly dubbed black hole sucking resource advanced technology component reliability failed meet apple rigorous standard source said example skin conductivity sensor showed promise early design later testing showed actual result varied person person everything hairy arm strap tightness contributing unreliable reading company also investigated incorporating blood pressure blood oxygen measurement feature result inconsistent apple seemingly investing health minded device program evidenced recently discovered job posting take mainstream approach first generation watch instead focusing exclusively health fitness device positioned niche filling fashion accessory io compatible smartwatch iphone companion daily communicator among others apple watch however sport apple feature including apple pay integration watchkit development tool expected foster rich ecosystem bite sized apps later year,eye health fitness project quickly dubbed black hole sucking resource advanced technology component reliability failed meet apple rigorous standard source said example skin conductivity sensor showed promise early design later testing showed actual result varied person person everything hairy arm strap tightness contributing unreliable reading company also investigated incorporating blood oxygen measurement feature result inconsistent apple seemingly investing health minded device program evidence recently discovered job posting take mainstream approach first generation watch . apple watch however sport apple feature including apple pay integration watchkit development tool expected foster rich ecosystem bite sized apps later year
31,"The picture of a possible ""Crabzilla"" measuring about 50 feet has surfaced after such creature was allegedly spotted at a harbor in the United Kingdom. The oddity has led many to ask: could this be real or simply a hoax?

The photograph of the monster crab first came out in the website Weird Whitstable, which collects exciting and unusual pictures of sightings reported in the town of Whitstable, Kent.

Quinton Winter, the curator of the website, reveals that a follower sent him the picture of the giant crab lurking at the Kent harbor. The satellite image of the crab shows the creature to be about 50 feet in size, more than four times bigger than the biggest crabs alive on the planet. Winter initially thought the crab-like image was due to some sort of sand formation; however, he now believes that it is an actual crab.

Winter says that he may have also seen the gigantic crab when he went for crabbing with his son in the summer of 2013.

""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that's a funny looking bit of driftwood,"" said Winter. ""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

Japanese spider crabs, found in the waters around Japan, are the biggest known living crab species is the world. The Japanese spider crab can weigh up to 12 kilograms (26.45 pounds) and its leg span can reach up to 3.8 meters (about 12 feet).

Even though some people believe that the giant crab image is real, there are some who believe it is a hoax and may be the result of computer image manipulation. The image could be an enlarged picture of an edible crab with the scientific name of Cancer pagurus, which is generally found in the waters surrounding the British Isles. However, this crab species is not as big as 50 feet but measures just about 10 inches and weighs just around six pounds.

33,"Early Tuesday morning, Dornella Conner was “riding around, respecting Mike Brown” with her boyfriend De’Angelas Lee when she was injured with flying shards of glass after police officers fired into her car with specialized “bean bag” bullets, designed to help control rioters and unruly protesters. According to Conner, she and Lee pulled up at a gas station, and were blocked off on all sides by approaching police officers before one of them fired their weapon, injuring Conner in her face. However, according to police officers, Conner’s boyfriend, De’Angelas, aggressively drove the car straight at them, which is why they decided to fire the bean bag into the car to stop their approach. Broken glass from the shattered car window flew into Conner’s eye, and despite being rushed to a hospital shortly after, doctors were unable to save her left eye.

She released a statement to Facebook:

38,"Saudi Arabian Airlines on Sunday dismissed claims made by some local media outlets that the national flag carrier is planning to segregate men and women on its flights.
Denying that such arrangements are being considered, Abdullah Al-Ajhar, the airline’s spokesman, termed the reports as “false” and “misleading.”
Speaking to Arab News, Al-Ajhar asserted that there are no plans to separate passengers based on their gender.
A few days ago, international media, quoting a local daily, reported that Saudia is planning to segregate according to gender, following complaints of uncomfortable journeys by male relatives of female passengers.
According to the report, some passengers complained that females sitting next to non-related male passengers felt uncomfortable.
In the report, the international news organization quoted Abdul Rahman Al-Fahd, airline’s vice president for marketing, as saying that measures would be taken to solve this problem.
However, the official concerned denied having made any statement on segregation. He asserted that his quote was taken out of context.
Al-Fahd tried to clear the air on the matter by tweeting what he claimed was his real response: “I answered: We are trying to find a solution and awaiting the outcome.”
In a significant but unrelated move, Saudia has extended the validity of domestic flight tickets from 6 months to 1 year from Jan. 1.

According to CNN, a Yorkville Endoscopy staff member told investigators the photograph was taken while Rivers was in the procedure room.

The 81-year-old entertainer went to the clinic to undergo a scheduled endoscopy by gastroenterologist and the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen, according to reports. After that procedure, CNN reports Rivers also underwent an unauthorized vocal cord biopsy performed by a physician, who hasn't been identified.

50,"Another rape allegation has surfaced against famed comedian and actor, Bill Cosby. This time it is from a familiar face which speculates that there may be some truth to Cosby's sketchy past.

Actress and singer Raven-Symone, who rose to fame with Cosby in the hit television sitcom ""The Cosby Show"", revealed to the TMZ offices that she too had been raped and drugged years ago following the shows last episode.

There are whispers that Cosby wouldn't allow Raven-Symone in the production of the last season of his show, but abruptly changed his mind. It was never revealed what changed his original intentions.

Her lawyer gave an announcement to the press, here is an excerpt:

""...we among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed. There was no monetary compensation that made my client keep quiet, but more so the respect for Mr. Cosby. Well that respect has come to an end. And what we thought was a mistake or anomaly has surfaced to become a lifestyle. We will be pursuing damages that are not going to be disclosed at this time.""

On Sunday, Cosby’s attorney issued a statement saying the accusers are rehashing “decade-old, discredited” allegations.

Lawyer John Schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated “does not make them true.” But this particular accusation is interesting. We have a very successful star in Raven-Symone who doesn't look to need any press or financial reward. Which makes us think that Cosby has a really shady past.

Cosby went silent when asked about the new allegations in an interview on NPR on Saturday In the interview, reporter Scott Simon asked Cosby about the claims, but the legendary comic just silently shook his head. To emphasize Cosby’s silence, Simon said, “You’re shaking your head no.”

Cosby has never been criminally charged with sexual assault, but he did settle a civil case in 2006 brought by Temple University employee Andrea Constand who claimed he drugged and groped her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion.

Differences between the two were ""resolved to the mutual satisfaction"" of both Cosby and Constand, according to a new statement issued Monday by their lawyers.

The media has since found some interesting clips from Cosby's past. Now, the Village Voice unearthed audio clips from the comedian’s ninth comedy album, “It’s True! It’s True,” which was released in 1969. An unfortunately titled compilation given the current headlines, the album includes a disturbing track of Cosby describing his long-standing desire to drug women and take advantage of them.

In the routine, Cosby describes his childhood fascination with a drug, “Spanish fly,” that supposedly makes women go crazy (or renders them incapacitated) if slipped into a drink. He says his fascination continued into adulthood, when he and “I Spy” co-star Robert Culp had the opportunity to go to Spain — and he became hopeful he might finally get his hands on some Spanish fly. Cosby describes how Culp, too, wanted to get his hands on the drug.

The latest round of bad press for Cosby started in October when comedian Hannibal Buress called him a “rapist” while performing a standup routine in Philadelphia.

57,"After sending a tweet that many observers said they believed was directed at Bill Cosby, a Twitter account claiming to be that of “The Cosby Show” actress Lisa Bonet was suspended. The account was suspended Saturday following a Nov. 21 tweet directed to no one in particular that piqued the attention of many in the media, including the New York Post and Fox News.

“According to the karma of past actions, one’s destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky… Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!” the tweet said.

Bonet starred as Denise Huxtable on “Cosby” and many said they believed the tweet was directed at her former on-screen father, who has of late suffered a devastating blow to his public persona. Public anger prompted numerous partners to sever relationships with the embattled actor and comedian as a result of allegations he raped more than a dozen women during his career that were reignited by comedian Hannibal Buress last month.

The account is no longer on Twitter, but it featured the Twitter handle @Lilakoi_Moon and used “Lisa Bonet” in its full name field. It also included a photo of the actress. Bonet changed her name to Lilakoi Moon while still acting under the name Lisa Bonet.

Cosby and Bonet were rumored to have had a falling out during the 1980s because Cosby did not approve of her decision to shoot a sexually explicit scene in the 1987 R-rated film “Angel Heart” or to pose topless for a photoshoot with Interview magazine. Bonet left “The Cosby Show” to shoot the spin-off “A Different World” but returned after giving birth. She parted ways with the show again in 1991 and chose not to be part of a reunion special.

The @Lilakoi_Moon account had been on the social networking service for a number of months, and before being shut down had garnered thousands of followers. The user sent tweets to verified Twitter accounts belonging to actor Kadeem Hardison and other members of the “Different World” cast. Representatives of Twitter did not immediately respond to requests from International Business Times to explain why the account was suspended.

An account said to be that of Cree Summer, the actress who played Winifred ""Freddie"" Brooks on “A Different World,” told followers that the @Lilakoi_Moon was fake in a tweet July 10.

I have to let everyone know that @Lilakoi_Moon is not a real account Lisa Bonet , my sister Lilakoi Moon is NOT on Twitter . Please do not

58,"When Tim Cook hits the stage Monday to reveal availability and pricing information about Apple Watch, the biggest question he will answer will be about the price of the high-end Edition line. Rumors have pegged that price to range between $5,000 and $20,000. Not a lot, perhaps, compared to a gold Rolex. But a 20-year-old Rolex will still tell the time. Who knows how functional the first Apple AAPL +0.97% Watch will be in five years?

There is now a new development in the pricing story. A new Apple patent has surfaced for a “Method and Apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite.” In simple terms, this new “Apple gold” is lighter, stronger and more scratch-resistant than ordinary 18 karat gold through alloys of low-density ceramic particles instead of precious metals. It also contains roughly half the amount of pure 24 karat gold as ordinary 18 karat gold (which is 75% gold, 15% silver, and 10% copper). The math is all explained in geeky detail on a blog called All This.

How much actual gold will be in the Apple Watch Edition? For the models on Apple’s current Edition page, the answer is about half an ounce (current value $640). What Apple isn’t showing on this page is a gold Edition with a solid gold link bracelet. This bracelet only appears in stainless steel on the Apple Watch Collection page. It is not an unreasonable assumption that Apple will roll out a gold link bracelet Edition, which could add another full ounce of gold (total current value $1,920).

Apple-Watch-Edition-value-of-gold

Still, with John Gruber of Daring Fireball estimating a price range of $10,000–$20,000 for the Edition, the profit margins start looking a little rich. Marco Arment is calling it at $5,000, but he is not talking about a solid gold bracelet. In the fine jewelry business, it is not uncommon for the retail price to be between five and ten times the cost of the raw materials. (see this analysis from Apple Spotlight on how much Tiffany customers pay for “form.”)


Apple reported in September that the profit margin for the entry level iPhone 6 was 69%, and slightly higher for the pricier models. That iPhone 6 costs Apple $216 to make, according to a teardown published in Re/code. Let’s assume that the basic Apple Watch will cost Apple no more than that, considering that it’s retail prices is supposed to start at $349. That would have the total cost to Apple for the Apple Watch Edition (without the gold link bracelet) at less than $1,000 and the model with the bracelet just above $2,000. The economics of the “Apple gold” could allow pricing with iPhone-level profit margins to be $2,999 and $6,999 respectively. For those expecting price points of $5,000 and $10,000, or $10,000 and $20,000, this “reasonable” pricing would be a welcome surprise.

As surprising as it is that the high-end Edition could contain so little actual gold, this is not at all a bad thing. Not only will this new process make the Apple Watch Edition lighter for delicate wrists and more resiliant, but it also might help the cause of (relatively) affordable luxury that Apple has championed. More significantly, this level of innovation in manufacturing follows through on Apple’s commitment to using fewer resources in its products. And since the mining of gold involves a lot of dangerous and underregulated human labor, it’s a win in an area that Apple has taken a lot of heat about for years. From the investor point of view, if the gold Apple Watch is a hit like the iPhone 6 Plus has been, the money saved on gold will add meaningfully to Apple’s already healthy bottom line.

Update: As reader Michal Kvasnica points out, the Apple Watch Edition will literally be worth its weight in gold. My original headline was intended rhetorically, not literally. Apple can claim its new gold metal matrix composite is 18 karat because it will be 75% solid gold by weight. The overall weight per volume is where Apple has achieved the savings. The low-density ceramic particles represent a surprising proportion of the volume of the material but still only contribute 25% to the weight. Since no one will buy an Apple Watch Edition with the intention of melting it down for gold, the real point is that “Apple gold” is great from an engineering perspective but bad in terms of intrinsic value. Passing the savings along to the (already overpaying) consumer reinforces Apple’s affordable luxury brand promise. A $10,000 starting price, in my opinion, would be abusing that promise.",tim cook hit stage monday reveal availability pricing information apple watch biggest question answer price high end edition line rumor pegged price range lot perhaps compared gold rolex year old rolex still tell time know functional first apple aapl watch five year new development pricing story new apple patent surfaced method apparatus forming gold metal matrix composite simple term new apple gold lighter stronger scratch resistant ordinary karat gold alloy low density ceramic particle instead precious metal also contains roughly half amount pure karat gold ordinary karat gold gold silver copper math explained geeky detail blog called much actual gold apple watch edition model apple current edition page answer half ounce current value apple showing page gold edition solid gold link bracelet bracelet appears stainless steel apple watch collection page unreasonable assumption apple roll gold link bracelet edition could add another full ounce gold total current value apple watch edition value gold still john gruber daring fireball estimating price range edition profit margin start looking little rich marco arment calling talking solid gold bracelet fine jewelry business uncommon retail price five ten time cost raw material see analysis apple spotlight much tiffany customer pay form apple reported september profit margin entry level iphone slightly higher pricier model iphone cost apple make according teardown published code let assume basic apple watch cost apple considering retail price supposed start would total cost apple apple watch edition without gold link bracelet le model bracelet economics apple gold could allow pricing iphone level profit margin respectively expecting price point reasonable pricing would welcome surprise surprising high end edition could contain little actual gold bad thing new process make apple watch edition lighter delicate wrist resiliant also might help cause relatively affordable luxury apple championed significantly level innovation manufacturing follows apple commitment using fewer resource product since mining gold involves lot dangerous underregulated human labor win area apple taken lot heat year investor point view gold apple watch hit like iphone plus money saved gold add meaningfully apple already healthy bottom line update reader michal kvasnica point apple watch edition literally worth weight gold original headline intended rhetorically literally apple claim new gold metal matrix composite karat solid gold weight overall weight per volume apple achieved saving low density ceramic particle represent surprising proportion volume material still contribute weight since one buy apple watch edition intention melting gold real point apple gold great engineering perspective bad term intrinsic value passing saving along already overpaying consumer reinforces apple affordable luxury brand promise starting price opinion would abusing promise,tim cook hit stage monday reveal availability pricing information apple watch biggest question answer price high end edition line rumor pegged price range lot perhaps compared gold rolex year old rolex still tell time know functional first apple aapl watch five year new development pricing story new apple patent surfaced method apparatus forming gold metal matrix composite simple term new apple gold lighter stronger scratch resistant ordinary karat gold alloy low density ceramic particle instead precious metal also contains roughly half amount pure karat gold ordinary karat gold gold silver copper math

66,"THE Islamic State may be harvesting the organs of victims to finance its terror operations, Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations says.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim said today that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” he said, referring to the UN Security Council.

“It is clear they are missing certain parts.”

HORROR: ISIS fanatics hurl public execution victims into deep ravine in Syria

HOSTAGE: Kayla Mueller’s boyfriend tried to save her from ISIS

Ambassador Alhakim also said a dozen doctors had been “executed” in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting, before briefing the council on the situation in Iraq, in which he accused ISIS of committing “crimes of genocide” in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mr Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that “it’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day.”

He said Iraq’s most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year, including a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria, where the Sunni militants have imposed strict Sharia law.

“Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,” Mr Mladenov said.

ISIS had recently confirmed the death of American aid worker and ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, who was kidnapped by the militant group in 2013 during what should have been a 10-minute trip to the bus station in Syria.

Ms Mueller, her boyfriend at the time, Alkhani, the taxi driver and a fourth person were ambushed and forced out of the vehicle at gunpoint and threatened with death.

Mueller remained a hostage, while Alkhani was released a couple of months later after being beaten and interrogated about his work as a photographer, his religion and his relationship to Mueller.

The terror group has also recently antagonised Egypt after releasing a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians.

67,"Mariam Al Mansouri's F-16 bombing raids were celebrated in the West

But a statement purporting to be from her UAE family has 'disowned' her

It attacks her for 'taking part in the brutal aggression against Syria'

The female air force pilot whose missions against Isis were dubbed 'boobs on the ground' has reportedly been disowned by her family and labelled an 'ingrate'.

Mariam Al Mansouri's participation in F-16 bombing raids for the UAE was celebrated in the West, but an anonymous statement claiming to be from her family 'disowned' her for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria.

It also expressed support for the Islamic State, saying 'we are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant'. The brutal terrorist group's original name was the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isil.

Courageous: Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She's pictured here in an F-16 Desert Eagle

Major Al Mansouri's F-16 fighter was one of several from a group of Arab nations that are blitzing Isis

In the name of God All Merciful.

'O ye who believe! Take not your fathers or your brethren for friends if they favour disbelief over faith. Those of you who taketh them for friends are wrong-doers.' [Quranic verse]

'Renouncement of Mariam Al Mansouri:

'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri.

'We hereby remind the Muslim nation all over the world of its duty to defend the causes of the nation [meaning the Islamic nation], and we urge them to take up the jihad [holy war] for the sake of God to support the blessed Syrian revolution against the descendants of Ibn Al Alqami.' [Sunni Islamist insurgents refer to the Shi'a as 'alqami' - a reference to Mu'ayyad al-Din Muhammad Ibn al-Alqami, a Shi'ite minister in the last Abbasid caliphate, who purportedly assisted the Mongols in conquering Baghdad in 1258.]

'We call upon all factions and battalions operating on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime perched on the pure and blessed Syrian land.

'Al Mansouri family, in the UAE and abroad, takes this opportunity to declare its support for the blessed Syrian revolution and to all free men defending their rights everywhere in the world.

'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [The Islamic Nation}. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. We may not know them, but God knows them and would champion them.

'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. All the honourable members of our family have agreed to this statement.

'Al Mansouri family.'

The statement also expressed support for the Syrian revolution, according to the Palestinian Wattan news agency.

It said: 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri.

'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri.'

It continued: 'We call upon all factions... on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime.

'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [the Islamic Nation]. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be.'

It's not clear whether the views expressed in the statement represent those of the entire family or indeed if it is genuine.

The Mansouri tribe has some influential members, including the country's economics minister, but it's also very large – the second biggest in Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE, so it certainly can't be assumed that the views expressed in the statement are representative of the whole group.

The statement could well have been made anonymously out of fear of punishment, as voicing dissent against the UAE government can result in imprisonment.

If true, the statement won't represent the first time the Mansouri family has been linked to extremism.

In January this year high-profile lawyer Mohammed al-Mansoori was jailed for allegedly trying to set up an 'international' branch of the controversial Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE, according to the BBC.

Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander.

She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature.

The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers.

She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.'

She says that her nearest relatives are supportive of her role in the air force.

There was also no difference between men and women with regards to training and assignments, she said.

'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence,'

Earlier this week Fox News host Eric Bolling apologised for calling Major Mansouri's missions as 'boobs on the ground'.

A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five.

During a segment about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria, Eric Bolling referred to her mission as 'boobs on the ground.'

Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized.

'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today.

'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.'

This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon.

'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said.

'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.'

Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force.

'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued.

'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them.

Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes.

It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark on Friday joined the U.S.-led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes on Isis.

The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency.

Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.'

'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a `walk on by' option.

There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.'

Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq.

That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria.

British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result.

The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition.

'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads.",mariam al mansouri f bombing raid celebrated west statement purporting uae family disowned attack

69,"The group calling itself the Islamic State (also ISIS or ISIL) has released a video purporting to show the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff, according to the Site Intelligence Group.

Sotloff is the second American journalist brutally murdered by ISIS in less than two weeks. On Aug. 20, the group released a video showing the execution of James Foley, during which they also promised to execute Sotloff if the U.S. did not cease airstrikes against the group in Iraq.

The video of Sotloff, which was posted by Site, was entitled, ""A Second Message To America.""

Based on a portion of the footage that was posted by Site and seen by Business Insider, it begins with footage of President Barack Obama speaking about the airstrikes the U.S. launched against Islamic State last month. It goes on to show Sotloff being held at knifepoint in an orange jumpsuit and behing forced to deliver a statement, a similar procedure for Foley in the video of his execution.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon he was not immediately ""in a position to determine the authenticity of the video."" He said the White House's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She said the intelligence community would work quickly to determine the video's authenticity.

In the video released Tuesday by ISIS — entitled ""A Second Message to America — Sotloff appears dressed in an orange jumpsuit before he is executed by an ISIS member.

Sotloff was kidnapped by militants upon crossing into Syria a little more than a year ago. He had been freelancing for Time and Foreign Policy magazines. Last week, his mother made an emotional plea to his captors and the Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

U.S. officials have said that Sotloff and Foley were among fewer than 10 Westerners being held hostage by the group. When asked again on Tuesday, Psaki said ""a few"" U.S. citizens were being held by ISIS.

This is a breaking news story and will be updated as we learn more information.

71,"The next iPhone's camera may see a massive leap in image quality, Apple Insider reports — if it gets the rumoured inclusion of optical image zoom for the first time.

The Apple news site is basing its report off rumours heard by the Japanese-language UDN and its ""ever-reliable sources in the Asian supply chain.""

Currently the iPhone — like almost every other smartphone — makes use of digital zoom. With digital zoom, zooming in doesn't add any extra detail to your photo — it just enlarges and enhances what's already captured. In contrast, optical zoom uses an actual lens to to magnify and capture significantly more detail without sacrificing image quality.

The camera in the iPhone 6 is already highly praised, but the rumoured new version will reportedly make use of a new dual-lens system to aid magnification — like compact cameras and professional SLRs.

It's a rumour in keeping with what we've already heard about the next iPhone. Blogger and developer John Gruber, who has an excellent track record on Apple product news, said that the next model may have ""the biggest camera jump ever.""

""I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses,"" Gruber said, ""and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.""

And that's not the only new prediction about the next iPhone from UDN. The Apple smartphone is also reportedly to include ""Force Touch,"" a pressure-sensitive touchscreen which is also included in the Apple Watch.

73,"Last Tuesday, College Humor posted a photo series titled ""This Is The Most Passive-Aggressive Office Battle We've Ever Seen"" depicting an exchange of break room notes that escalates into a full-scale sandwich hostage crisis. It was pretty funny, but also totally fake, as made clear by the extensive watermarks and ""CH Staff"" byline, an attribution the site reserves for original works like last year's phony Breaking Bad finale script.
The obvious joke wasn't quite as obvious, however, when someone cropped out the ""College Humor"" watermarks and posted the images on Reddit, the bottomless well from which all deadline-facing bloggers drink. From there the clearly staged photos were picked up far and wide, earning credulous coverage from the Daily Mail, the Mirror and Fox 32 Chicago, which ran the headline ""Lunch theft prompts ransom note from sandwich thief.""

When those news organizations did try to credit the pictures, they generally cited the Facebook page of a New Zealand radio station, which—as most non-journalists could probably tell you—isn't a real source.

But probably the funniest write-up of all came from Rupert Murdoch's News.com.au.

79,"DEVELOPING: An Internet video purports to show the beheading of US reporter Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State extremist group.

The global terror intelligence firm SITE first reported the release of the video, titled ""A Second Message to America,"" in which Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, speaks to the camera before a cloaked Islamic State fighter decapitates him.

“I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing,” Sotloff said. ""Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?”

The video then cuts to the masked militant warning that as long as U.S. missiles “continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.” He also threatens the life of British captive David Cawthorne Haines.

The grim video comes just days after Sotloff's mother, Shirley, directly addressed the leader of the Islamic State last week, saying her son shouldn't pay for U.S. government actions in the Middle East and that he cared about the weak and oppressed as a journalist.

""I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children's children,"" she said last week. ""I plead with you to grant me this.""

Shirley Sotloff cited by name the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has described himself as a caliph intending to lead the Muslim world. She had asked him to show mercy and follow the example of the prophet Muhammad in protecting people of Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths.

Sotloff was last seen in August 2013 in Syria. He was recently threatened with death by the militants on a video unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq. The same video showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley, 45.

Several U.S. officials, including U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., have said they were working behind the scenes to find out more about Sotloff and try to secure his release.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest could not confirm the reports when asked about the video at Tuesday’s press briefing. He noted the administration has been monitoring his situation carefully since threats were first made.

“The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff,” he said, adding “thoughts and prayers” are with the family.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the intelligence community will work “as quickly as possible” to determine the video’s authenticity.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act taking the life of another innocent American citizen,” she told reporters.

Pressed by Fox News, Psaki would not say whether this would constitute an act of war. She said the prior execution of journalist James Foley was a “horrific terrorist act,” and was a “motivating” factor for creating a coalition to address the Islamic State.

90,"The world was outraged yesterday when RadarOnline.com confirmed that Joan Rivers doctor Gwen Korovin took a selfie in the operating room just moments before Rivers stopped breathing on the table. Now, only RadarOnline.com has all the details of the sick shot — and why investigators are now cracking down on the shady doc after Rivers’ tragic death.

Staff from Yorkville Endoscopy, the clinic where Rivers was treated, told medical investigators looking into the death of the 81-year-old that “Dr. Korovin took the selfie with her personal cell phone,” an insider tells Radar.

What’s more, an unconscious Rivers “was in the shot,” the source reveals. “She was under anesthesia at this point. Everyone in the operating room was just stunned as they had never witnessed anyone do that before.”

PHOTOS: Celebrities Who Died In Bizarre Circumstances

It was only a few minutes later that Dr. Korovin performed the unauthorized biopsy ​that preceded Rivers’ death.

“Joan never consented to the procedure,” the source says. “And Dr. Korovin never should have been in the operating room to begin with — certainly not to perform any procedure on Joan, since she didn’t have privileges to do so at the clinic.”

Medical investigators are now “eager to talk to Dr. Korovin about the events leading up to and after Joan’s death,” the source claims. “They will certainly be asking what the purpose of taking the selfie was for, and they will want to see it.”

Meanwhile, “Joan’s daughter Melissa has been telling friends that she is a spineless monster,” the source said.

Under the care of Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who performed the endoscopy on Rivers, and her E.N.T. Specialist Korovin, Rivers stopped breathing and later died.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

The source added, “Melissa just can’t believe a doctor would be so cavalier, especially someone with Dr. Korovin’s credentials. Joan was completely vulnerable while under anesthesia, and for her privacy to be violated like that just makes Melissa sick.”",world outraged yesterday radaronline com confirmed joan river doctor gwen korovin took selfie operating room moment river stopped breathing table radaronline com detail sick shot investigator cracking shady doc river tragic death staff yorkville endoscopy clinic river treated told medical investigator looking death year old dr korovin took selfie personal cell phone insider tell radar unconscious river shot source reveals anesthesia point everyone operating room stunned never witnessed anyone photo celebrity died bizarre circumstance minute later dr korovin performed unauthorized biopsy preceded river death joan never consented procedure source say dr korovin never operating room begin certainly perform procedure joan since privilege clinic medical investigator eager talk dr korovin event leading joan death source claim certainly asking purpose taking selfie want see photo hollywood plastic surgeon tell star lipo lift tuck meanwhile joan daughter melissa telling friend spineless monster source said care dr lawrence cohen performed endoscopy river e n specialist korovin river stopped breathing later died dr cohen doubled clinic medical director since parted way yorkville clinic confirmed departure stating dr cohen currently performing procedure currently serving medical director source added melissa believe doctor would cavalier especially someone dr korovin credential joan completely vulnerable anesthesia privacy violated like make melissa sick,joan river doctor gwen korovin took selfie operating room moment river stopped breathing table radaronline com detail sick shot investigator cracking shady doc river tragic death staff yorkville endoscopy clinic river treated told medical investigator looking death year old dr korovin took selfie operating room moment river stopped breathing table radaronline com detail sick shot investigator cracking shady doc river tragic death staff yorkville endoscopy clinic river treated told medical investigator looking death year old d
92,"An unfortunate woman in South Korea was left in ‘agony’ after being partially eaten by a robot vacuum cleaner.

The Guardian reports that the woman was sleeping on the floor while the autonomous roving vacuum did its job.

But disaster struck when her hair became trapped in the mechanism after the machine mistook it for dust.

Fortunately the 52-year-old woman from Changing City was able to get help in time.

The woman was immediately woken by the pain, and called the local fire department with what the Yonhap news agency reported as a “desperate rescue plea”.

She was eventually separated from the machine by paramedics and was not seriously injured. Reports say she lost ""about 10 strands"" of hair.

South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun did not report on the specific brand of vacuum involved - though another local news source said that since sleeping on the floor is more common in the country, people may be at more risk from robotic disaster.

LG Display will be the sole supplier of the p-OLED display for the Apple Watch, according to Park’s recent note to investors. His firm also predicts LG’s stock could jump as much as 25% because of the new deal.

J.P Morgan estimates LG’s Apple Watch deal could generate $1.4 trillion in revenue for the company in 2015, assuming the average sale price for a tiny p-OLED is $45 the entire year. The team forecasts Apple will ship 29 million watches this year. By 2016 that number could more than double to 61 million based on their projections.

96,"The news: If you've been keeping up with the images of protests coming out of Hong Kong, you might have noticed a recurring gesture among the protesters.
That's right: To demonstrate peaceful intent to the riot police, protesters have been raising their empty hands in the air.

A common thread: As many online commentators have noted, there's a striking similarity between the gesture of the ""umbrella revolution"" taking place in Hong Kong and the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture from the protests in Ferguson, Mo.




Is there an actual connection? It doesn't look like the hands-up gesture by Hong Kong protesters is a callback to the events still unfolding in Ferguson. As reported by Quartz, ""The gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.""

While the gesture might not have been a deliberate cultural reference like Thai protesters adopting the Hunger Games salute, the unplanned nature of its similarity to the Ferguson gesture makes it all the more powerful: Although the two sites of protest are a world apart from each other and are fighting against very different sociopolitical issues, both movements are dealing with police brutality and demonstrating peaceful intent in an act of nonviolent civil unrest.

And the fact that Ferguson protesters are marching in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters makes it all the more moving:

97,"Mittens, an ordinary cat with an incredibly ordinary name, is a hermaphrodite whose owner will be giving it gender assignment surgery [via CBC News]. Newfoundland, Canada, resident Colleen Clarke-Murphy was surprised to find out her cat was had male and female sex organs during a vet visit.

Mittens, a stray brought in by Clarke-Murphy's daughter, would need to be spayed and neutered and then assigned a gender. Taking the advice of her veterinarian, Clarke-Murphy will make Mittens male. The assignment will help Mittens with bowel and urinary problems he previously had.

98,"Wen Apple first released the iPhone and iPad, their launches were limited to the US before rolling out to other countries over the following months. It appears that won’t be the case with the Apple Watch.

While speaking at an Apple Store in Berlin last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees the new wearable will launch in Germany during April, according to 9to5Mac.

In January, Tim Cook said the Apple Watch would be shipping in April, but it was unclear which countries would be included in the initial launch. Cook’s statement suggests a wider initial roll-out than we’ve seen before for new product categories from the company.

It’s possible the Apple Watch will launch in the US first with other countries coming later in the month. In any case, it seems Apple fans outside the US won’t have long to wait before they can get their hands on the wearable.

Argentina's President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner just took on Iair Tawil as a godson. True.
Thing is, Iair is a 21-year-old son of a rabbi, and now, Argentina's first Jewish presidential godson, even though he's not a baby and is at no risk of becoming a lycanthrope.
Apparently several news agencies, which we won't be making fun of for reporting something so ridiculous, claimed that the president adopted a baby to keep it from becoming a werewolf.
In Argentina, the legend of the lobizón is similar to the standard werewolf legend. Basically, in the Argentinian legend, the seventh son of a seventh son was suuuuuper susceptible to becoming a werewolf.
What's funny is this apparently has nothing to do with the Argentinian tradition of the seventh son (or daughter) of a family being eligible to become the President's godchild. That tradition was apparently brought over by Russian immigrants in 1907.
President Fernández is already godmother to around 700 children after taking office in 2007.
Regardless, it's still pretty cute this 21-year-old man became her godson!
We love they're all lighting a menorah too, seeing as how only Christian babies used to be eligible to become presidential godchildren!

101,"Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced on Dec. 23 that she had adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf-like creature.

According to Argentine folklore, the seventh son of a family will turn into a werewolf-like creature called “el lobizón” when he turns 13. The lobizón feeds on excrement and unbaptized babies.

The Argentine president will now become the official godparent of any family that has seven sons or daughters. The tradition dates back to 1907. In 1973, the Argentine government extended it to baby girls.

Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía.

Yair Tawil, Kirchner’s newest godson, is the first Jewish person to be adopted, however. Kirchner said the tradition only included Catholics until 2009.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad…

The ceremony began in 1907 in an effort to demystify the folklore and prevent the abuse of children, but has since become a time-honored tradition. The anti-lobizón adoption ceremony also includes a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas…

The boy’s parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president’s office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.

102,"People with ties to Islamic State are reportedly trying to negotiate the sale of American hostage James Foley's remains, according to BuzzFeed News.

ISIS is reportedly attempting to sell the body and deliver it across the Syrian border to Turkey, sources in contact with the terror group told Mike Giglio at BuzzFeed.

One source told BuzzFeed that an ISIS leader approached him about the sale of Foley's body and asked if he could get in contact with someone within the US government or Foley's family.

ISIS executed Foley on camera and posted the video online in August. He was captured in northwest Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

The terror group makes millions of dollars from its hostages.

They typically demand ransoms from the countries the hostages are from, but some countries, like the US, refuse to pay up. Selling Foley's remains seems to be a way for ISIS to make money off of him in lieu of a ransom.

Since Foley's death, ISIS has executed three other Western hostages — US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker Alan Henning, and US aid worker Peter Kassig. The executions seem to be retaliation for airstrikes in the Middle East.

103,"Turns out Bilbo might be a bad influence.

This discipline measure may not have been made with Gandalf-level wisdom.

According to the New York Daily News, a nine-year-old boy in Texas was suspended from school for telling a classmate that he could make him vanish using J.R.R. Tolkien-inspired sorcery.

Fourth grader Aiden Steward last week apparently told his friend that he could make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins by placing the ring on his head … and Kermit Elementary School officials deemed it a “terroristic threat,” reports Odessa American.

Steward’s father, though, just says it was harmless fun, inspired by their family viewing of “The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies” days prior.

“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” Jason Stweard wrote in an email. “If he did, I’m sure he’d bring him right back.”

Steward told the New York Daily News that his son “didn’t mean anything by it.” The school principal refused to comment on the story, citing student confidentiality.

Iga Jasica, 19, was undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous growth from inside her head at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland when the incident happened.

Neurosurgeons had removed the top part of her skull and were in the process of taking out parts of the growth when suddenly she woke up.

But instead of panicking or crying out in pain, Miss Jasica began calmly talking to doctors and asked how her operation was going.

Medics say she was unable to see or feel anything that was happening to her, but for some reason had regained consciousness and the ability to speak.

Doctors say it is possible that the brain surgery caused neurons to trigger which could have woken Miss Jesica up, but investigators are probing whether the anesthetic was administered incorrectly.

Despite having part of her skull removed and her brain exposed, Miss Jasica began talking to doctors about how her operation was going, and cats - her favourite animal

Medics added that it was extremely unusual for a patient to come round during surgery, especially while their brain was exposed.

After the operation Miss Jasica said: 'I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

111,"A Kermit parent said his fourth-grade student was suspended Friday for allegedly making a terroristic threat.
His father, Jason Steward, said the family had been to see “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” last weekend. His son brought a ring to his class at Kermit Elementary School and told another boy his magic ring could make the boy disappear.
Steward said the principal said threats to another child’s safety would not be tolerated – whether magical or not. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the matter.
“All student stuff is confidential,” Greer said. She referred a call from the Odessa American to Kermit ISD Superintendent Bill Boyd, who did not return a phone call.
Steward said he didn’t understand why his son was removed from school and why the district didn’t just send a letter home.
He said he requested that the school send him “something in writing” saying that the school suspended his son and why they suspended him. Steward was told the school would put the letter in the mail.

122,"Jasmine Tridevil, 21, 'paid $20,000 to add a breast to become a TV star'

She was 'rejected by 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes'

It took her two years to find willing surgeon who would also add a nipple

She now has a film crew tracking her 'struggles as a three-breasted woman'

A 21-year-old woman claims to have paid $20,000 to surgically add a third breast in a desperate bid to become a reality TV star.

Jasmine Tridevil, not her real name, insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure.

Now, she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, Florida, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Three-breasted? Jasmine Tridevil, 21, claims she paid $20,000 to have a third breast surgically attached to her chest. She is now filming her own reality show about the struggles she faces as a three-breasted woman

Surgeons are reluctant to perform unnatural procedures as the ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done.

'My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me,' Tridevil said.

Dreams of being a star: The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida, said her dream is to have a show on MTV

'My dad… he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.'

However, Tridevil insists she has no regrets as she prepares to send pilot episodes of her self-produced reality show titled Jasmine's Jugs to MTV.

'My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,' she told Real Radio 104.1.

'I'm dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn't work, I'm through.'

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

Reminiscent: Her new look is similar to that of the three-breasted prostitute in the 1990 film Total Recall

Disowned: Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says she has been disowned by her mother

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

The new look is reminiscent of the alluring three-breasted prostitute who parades around semi-topless in the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

123,"A grieving Afghan mother took bloody revenge on the Taliban militants who gunned down her son, killing 25 and injuring five of them during a seven hour gun battle.

Reza Gul watched helplessly as her son died while he manned a village checkpoint with his small team of police officers in the lawless Farah province.

But flanked by her daughter and daughter-in-law, she led a counter strike on his attackers killing 25 militants and wounding another five during a ferocious seven hour gun battle.

'I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,' Gul told TOLO News. 'I went to the check post and began shooting back.'

Her daughter-in-law Seema added: 'The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.'

She added that the combats zone was strewn with Taliban bodies when the fighting was over.

A spokesman for the Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior told the agency it was a symbol of a public uprising.

The Taliban is yet to comment about the incident.

Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month.

Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially in the country's capital Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire.

At least 50 people were injured earlier this week, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament at an inter-district competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces.

He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered a top-to-bottom inspection of his country's military forces after a rise in Taliban attacks

The latest attacks come as it was revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal.

The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed.

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years.

Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the US and NATO allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country.

127,"Michael Jackson, legendary as he was as the King of Pop, wasn’t the most the popular dad in showbiz. Ever since the Berlin baby-dangling incident of ’02, the media has tirelessly and unfairly portrayed him as an irresponsible and detached father (before his death, Jackson had shown remorse for the incident). This depiction was unfortunately fueled by his own erratic behavior during the final years of his life, and the sexual abuse charges that chased Jackson a few years before his death certainly didn’t help with his image.

This week, social media went crazy over a “news” article that had been circulating Facebook and Twitter like wildfire. An article published by Empire News entitled, “DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars,” has unsurprisingly shocked and enraged fans of both singers across the internet.

The story went on to detail how the Billionaire singer allegedly and inadvertently revealed where he got his singing genes. The article wrote that the discovery involved Mars’ firing of a certain Vladimir Kershov, the singer’s reported publicist.

“Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.”

Gullible netizens went insane over the Michael Jackson-Bruno Mars story, not realizing that Empire News, an Onion-like website (without the funny), publishes mostly “satirical” and made-up articles. Fact-checking website Snopes has since labelled the story “false”.

According to Bruno’s Wikipedia page, the half-Filipino singer was born to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette Bayot in 1985 and was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Meanwhile, Michael was, at the time, not involved with anyone, although he was already beginning to form a relationship with future-wife Lisa Marie Presley.

While Jackson was often portrayed as a bad dad in tabloids, he was, in reality, an amazing father to his kids Michael Jr, Paris and Prince. Shortly after his death, MTV revealed never-before seen correspondence with people closest to Michael, most of whom attested to the fact that the singer was a caring and loving dad to his children. Producer and Jackson’s friend Teddy Reily recalled, “Michael] read them a book every day. When we were in Virginia during the Invincible [sessions], there was not one day missed reading the children something. So that showed me right there that he was an incredible father.”

In other news, Michael Jackson’s brothers continue to celebrate his musical legacy through various performances around the world. Inquisitr recently reported about the brothers’ upcoming UAE concert, which is set to be attended by thousands of fans.

128,"UPDATE: Sod Crabzilla, Now Budapest Is Under Attack From A Furious Giant

Behold – there is a ocean-dwelling beast lurking off the shore of Whitstable.

Yes, the sleepy seaside town famed for its oysters and cream teas is now apparently home to a giant sea monster, which has rightly earned the moniker ‘Crabzilla’.

A satellite image of the colossal crustacean – thought to be 50ft across - surfaced on Weird Whitstable, an online journal dedicated to tall tales in the area.

Could it be...?

Blog curator Quinton Winter revealed to The Express he had encountered the decapod himself: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sandbank. Now I know better.”

Winter first made reference to the giant crab in July last year when he published a wholly unconvincing image of an oversized shellfish poking its claws out of the water below two blissfully unaware children playing on the pier.

It was accompanied with the explanation: “This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend.

“The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passerbys shouted to them, the crab silently slipped away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

According to the Marine Biological Association of the UK, the biggest crab in the world is the Japanese Spider Crab, which can grow up to 3.7m across.

Crabzilla, however appears to be shaped like an edible crab, commonly found in British waters and growing up to 5 inches in width.

129,"A woman has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticized Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci-fi film “Total Recall.”

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like … we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.",woman spent surgery get third breast dream become celebrity florida massage therapist call jasmine tridevil said surgery month ago really hard finding someone would breaking code ethic tridevil told real radio called like doctor nobody wanted last month posted youtube video bikini radiohead creep play background tridevil said extra breast felt like breast difference nipple get tattooed year old saved two year could surgery also paying film crew follow around photo faceook whole dream get show mtv said dumping every penny work tridevil said wanted fame fortune surgery got wanted make unattractive men want date anymore said filmed telling parent third boob happy mum ran door talk let sister talk dad really happy kind ashamed accepted said criticized tridevil chasing fame others described beautiful commented reminds girl sci fi film total recall love boob three like loved girl total recall sic real deal said one follower facebook page,spent surgery get third breast dream become celebrity florida massage therapist call jasmine tridevil said surgery month ago really hard finding someone would breaking code ethic tridevil told real radio called like doctor nobody wanted last month posted youtube video bikini radiohead creep play background tridevil said extra breast felt like breast difference nipple get tattooed year old saved two year could surgery also paying film crew follow around photo faceook whole dream get show mtv said mtv said dumping every penny
131,"The Islamic State group is allegedly closing in on Baghdad, according to a report from a vicar at Iraq's only Anglican church that claims the jihadists formerly known as ISIS are roughly one mile away from the Iraqi capital. Airstrikes against ISIS targets were supposed to stop the group from taking Baghdad.

“The Islamic State are now less than 2km (1.2 miles) away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has,” Canon Andrew White of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, a British-based charity that supports Iraq’s only Anglican church in Baghdad, said on his Facebook page early Monday morning. “Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well, you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very, very little.”

The Christian aid group was referring to the U.S. president’s interview Sunday night on “60 Minutes,” the CBS news magazine show, where Obama conceded that his administration underestimated the ascendancy of ISIS. More than 1,000 Iraqi troops were reportedly killed Sunday in clashes with ISIS about 10 miles outside of Baghdad.

The advance by ISIS toward Baghdad shows that the group isn't weakening despite U.S.-led airstrikes in Iraq. ISIS executed 300 Iraqi soldiers last week during their march toward the Iraqi capital and attempted to break into a prison in northern Baghdad.

""This attack is very significant. It is the first infantry-like, complex, and penetrating attack in Baghdad city by ISIS since the fall of Mosul in June of this year,"" the Washington-based nonprofit Institute for the Study of War wrote on its website, referring to Iraq's second-largest city, which is in the Islamic State's hands. ""ISIS likely carried out the attack to release some of the pressure it is facing as a result of the recent U.S. air campaign targeting its positions. The attack also signifies that, despite the heightened defenses of Baghdad in the aftermath of the fall of Mosul, ISIS is still able to carry out attacks in an area where it is unlikely to have active sleeper cells.""

U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have come under criticism over their effectiveness. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the military action last week in a CNN interview. Kerry claimed “Baghdad could have fallen” if it weren't for the airstrikes, which have predominantly been launched in the northern part of Iraq.",islamic state group allegedly closing baghdad according report vicar iraq anglican church claim jihadist formerly known isi roughly one mile away iraqi capital airstrikes isi target supposed stop group taking baghdad islamic state le km mile away entering baghdad said could never happen almost canon andrew white foundation relief reconciliation middle east british based charity support iraq anglican church baghdad said facebook page early monday morning obama say overestimated iraqi army could well need short know little christian aid group referring u president interview sunday night minute cbs news magazine show obama conceded administration underestimated ascendancy isi iraqi troop reportedly killed sunday clash isi mile outside baghdad advance isi toward baghdad show group weakening despite u led airstrikes iraq isi executed iraqi soldier last week march toward iraqi capital attempted break prison northern baghdad attack significant first infantry like complex penetrating attack baghdad city isi since fall mosul june year washington based nonprofit institute study war wrote website referring iraq second largest city islamic state hand isi likely carried attack release pressure facing result recent u air campaign targeting position attack also signifies despite heightened defense baghdad aftermath fall mosul isi still able carry attack area unlikely active sleeper cell u led airstrikes isi iraq syria come criticism effectiveness u secretary state john kerry defended military action last week cnn interview kerry claimed baghdad could fallen airstrikes predominantly launched northern part iraq,isis allegedly closing baghdad according report vicar iraq anglican church claim jihadist formerly known isi roughly one mile away iraqi capital airstrikes isi target supposed stop group taking baghdad . obama conceded administration underestimated ascendancy isi iraqi troop reportedly killed sunday clash isi mile outside baghdad advance isi toward baghdad show group weakening despite heightened defense baghdad aftermath
133,"An Indian bride has married a guest at her wedding after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed.

Reports said the groom, Jugal Kishore, was epileptic and he had kept the information from the bride, Indira, and her family.

While Mr Kishore was taken to hospital, the angry bride decided to switch husbands.

She asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, who was a guest, to step in and marry her instead. He agreed.

The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

According to a report in The Times of India, Mr Kishore, 25, fell to the ground in front of the wedding guests just as he was reaching out to garland Indira.

On his return from the hospital, Mr Kishore pleaded with Indira to change her mind, telling her that he would be ridiculed by friends and relatives if he went home without a bride, but she refused.

Local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki told the BBC that Mr Kishore and his family were initially upset and lodged a complaint with the police.

138,"Absolutely no one was devastated when news broke last week that 26-year-old Afton Elaine “Star” Burton would not be marrying 80-year-old psychopath felon Charles Manson after all. But as it turns out, there’s more to the story than their wedding license expiring.

Just in case you needed more nightmare fuel… ((AP Photos/California Department of Corrections)
The New York Post is reporting that journalist Daniel Simone learned the true reason behind the nixed nuptials: Manson’s fiancee was marrying him to get access to his corpse.

According to Simone, Star isn’t quite the deranged Manson maniac we all thought she was. She was a woman with a plan. Not a good plan, necessarily. But a plan.

When Manson keeled over, Star reportedly envisioned putting the murderous cult leader on display Lenin-style in a glass coffin so she could charge money to morbid looky-loos.



Manson was allegedly less-than-pleased with this idea and called off the unholy prison wedding — potentially the only good thing he’s ever done his life. The Post has all the details, including this masterpiece of insanity:

Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. “He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

Manson is housed in California State Prison, Corcoran and is presumably now looking for a life partner who is not interested in profiting off his disgusting corpse.

141,"Hewlett Packard plans to split into two companies on Monday, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. One company will be focused on enterprise computing and services, and the other will build and sell PCs and printers.

Current HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the enterprise-focused version of HP (it’s not clear who gets to keep the iconic name) and will be chairman of the PC/printer company, which will be led by Dion Weisler as CEO. Details are still fuzzy as to how this will all work, but WSJ reported that HP plans to announce the move on Monday.

HP is perhaps the seminal Silicon Valley company, with a rich history of computing breakthroughs and technology leadership since it was founded in 1939. But despite taking in $112 billion in revenue in 2013 (split almost evenly between the groups that will form the two separate companies) it has struggled over the last decade with the decline of the PC market, the rise of mobile computing, and the shift to enterprise cloud computing.

145,"Apple has multiple versions of its upcoming smartwatch. This we already know. And while we don’t know the specific price points of each model, the consensus is that the Watch Edition will be the most expensive of all three thanks to its 18-karat gold casing. Though the Apple Watch Sport will cost $349 USD when it launches, the Edition is rumoured to cost thousands of dollars.

Apple is used to selling expensive merchandise in its stores, but the Watch Edition is different to anything else the company has sold, and it will be modifying its stores appropriately. According to 9to5Mac, Apple will be implementing some new security measures to ensure the watches aren’t stolen while they’re sitting in the store or when people are trying them on.

Sources are quoted as saying there will be special safes for the Edition. These will be equipped with MagSafe connectors to keep the watches charged and will house inventory during the day as well as the show floor demo models overnight.

Perhaps most interesting of all is that Apple will reportedly also have scales that employees will use to weigh the watches before they’re sold. This is not for the customer’s bragging rights but so Apple will know whether customers returning their watches are returning all of their watches.

150,"""My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that’s fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.""

UNION TOWNSHIP, Ohio — A 17-year-old transgender teen was struck and killed by a passing semi trailer on an Ohio interstate on Sunday, and a previously written suicide note later appeared on the teen’s Tumblr blog through scheduled publishing.

Leelah Alcorn was in the roadway when she was struck, and is believed to have walked 3-4 miles from her parents house in nearby Kings Mill, Ohio.

Police say she died at 2:20 a.m. Sunday.

The incident is being investigated by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, but local media have reported the incident as the death of a teen “boy,” using Leelah’s (male) birth name, and have made no mention that she was transgender.

Following the incident, this entry appeared on Leelah’s blog describing the pain of being “a girl trapped in a boy’s body” and her Christian parents’ refusal to allow her to transition:

SUICIDE NOTE

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

I formed a sort of a “fuck you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.

So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.

At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn’t actually give a shit about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Goodbye,

(Leelah) Josh Alcorn

153,"A top Iraqi diplomat told world leaders that ISIS is harvesting the organs of its victims to fund it murderous operations, the latest charge of barbarity in a list that already includes mass beheadings, burning people alive, crucifying children and throwing people off of buildings.

The shocking new claim was presented by the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, who said bodies have turned up in mass graves bearing surgical incisions and missing organs such as kidneys. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim leveled the charge as he asked the Security Council to investigate whether harvesting and selling the organs of those it executes. The claim followed an unconfirmed report late Tuesday that as many as 45 people captured by the Islamic State in the Anbar Province town of al-Baghdadi had been rounded up and burned alive.

""We have bodies,"" Alhakim told his international counterparts. ""Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

Alhakim, who said a dozen doctors have been executed in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting, briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mladenov said.

The identities of the victims who were reportedly burned alive Tuesday in al-Baghdadi are not clear, the local police chief told the BBC. ISIS fighters reportedly captured most of the town last week.

Col. Qasim Obeidi, pleading for help from the Iraqi government and international community, said a compound that houses families of security personnel and officials was now being targeted.

The reports come days after ISIS released a video purportedly showing the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians along a beach in Libya, sparking an international outcry, including commendation from Pope Francis, who called the killings ""barbaric.”

Earlier this month, ISIS released another video showing a fleet of vehicles flying the black ISIS flag and driving through what is believed to be the streets of Benghazi, Libya. The video shows the vehicles being cheered by men, women and children as they drive by.

On Friday, a media group linked to ISIS released a four-minute video titled ""Peshmerga Captives in Kirkuk Province,” which purportedly showed Kurdish prisoners -- imprisoned in iron cages -- being driven around on trucks in Iraq, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute.

The imagery of the prisoner convoy in orange uniforms was similar to the scenes of an execution of a Jordanian pilot. In a video released by ISIS two weeks ago, Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh was shown being burned alive in a cage.

Al-Baghdadi, which is about 50 miles northwest of Ramadi in Anbar province, is located about five miles from Ain al-Asad air base, where 400 U.S. military personnel are training Iraqi soldiers and Sunni tribesmen to take on ISIS. The base was raided last week by a small band of fighters, in what some experts believe may have been a probe in preparation for a full-scale attack.

The base has been the target of sporadic mortar fire in past weeks, and the jihadist army has been moving forces from its strongholds in Syria to Anbar Province, possibly setting the stage for a major clash with forces on the base that is now the sole bulwark between ISIS and Baghdad.

There are currently nearly 2,600 U.S. forces in Iraq, including about 450 who are training Iraqi troops at three bases across the country, including al-Asad. Forces from other coalition countries conduct the training at the fourth site, in the northern city of Irbil.

But even if Islamic State militants close in on the base, taking it would require a massive force, that would present a target for airstrikes, retired Col. Thomas Lynch, a National Defense University fellow, told Fox News.

Cops caught the thieves after IDing them with surveillance video.   The black bag belonged to Tridevel, but before she got it back it was inventoried by police as part of the case against the crooks.

Guess what was inside the bag?  ""A 3 breast prosthesis.""

BTW ... she told cops the prosthesis was valued at $5K.

160,"Isis fighters are reportedly just one mile away from Baghdad as reports emerge of al-Qaeda militants bolstering their ranks in Syria.

According to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, Isis was approaching the Iraqi capital on Monday morning, report The Independent.

""The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,"" a spokesperson said.

""They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little.""

The news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front.

The group is the Syrian offshoot of al-Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war.

Despite months of clashes between its forces and Isis (also known as Islamic State) militants, the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies.

Al-Nusra’s official spokesperson, Abu Firas al-Suri, threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday.

“These states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world,” he said.

“This is not a war against al-Nusra, but a war against Islam.”

Al-Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together, a source told the Guardian, although no formal alliance has been confirmed.

The reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis, which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an “Islamic State” straddling Iraq and Syria.

A loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al-Nusra in June in the town of Al-Bukamal near the Iraqi border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and the two groups have fought together against Government forces.

The report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al-Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin.

Although both Isis and al-Nusra are rooted in al-Qaeda, the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syria’s civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3,000 militants from both sides.

A merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2013, when Isis was known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), but the alliance was rejected by al-Nusra and overruled by al-Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri.

But the international response to Isis’ bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria, and the beheadings of British and American hostages, is pushing the groups towards an alliance.

An al-Nusra source told Reuters: “There are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State.”

A formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

A deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources, equipment stores and slow its advances.

The US has not said al-Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan, which some analysts suspect is part of al-Nusra.

The two groups have been known to co-operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al-Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Britain, the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al-Nusra as a terrorist group, citing its use of suicide bombing, terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law.

A small number of anti-Government groups, including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army, opposed the label after al-Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime.",isi fighter reportedly one mile away baghdad report emerge al qaeda militant bolstering rank syria according foundation relief reconciliation middle east isi approaching iraqi capital monday morning report independent islamic state le km away entering baghdad spokesperson said said could never happen almost obama say overestimated iraqi army could well need short know little news come amid report emerging alliance isi force syria jabhat al nusra also known nusra front group syrian offshoot al qaeda fighting assad regime civil war despite month clash force isi also known islamic state militant two group appear forming loose coalition part country fight increasing attack u ally advertisement al nusra official spokesperson abu firas al suri threatened coalition nation retaliation saturday state committed horrible act going put list jihadist target throughout world said war al nusra war islam al nusra isi leader holding war planning meeting together source told guardian although formal alliance confirmed report follow growing defection islamist group isi seen better organised equipped create islamic state straddling iraq syria loyalty pledge reportedly made al nusra june town al bukamal near iraqi border syrian observatory human right said two group fought together government force report appeared confirmed twitter photograph showing egyptian al nusra front commander shaking hand isi leader chechen origin although isi al nusra rooted al qaeda two rival since isi started involvement syria civil war spring last year engaged bloody battle killing militant side merger declared isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi isi known al qaeda iraq aqi alliance rejected al nusra overruled al qaeda leader al zawahiri international response isi bloody rampage iraq syria beheading british american hostage pushing group towards alliance al nusra source told reuters hardline voice inside nusra pushing reconciliation islamic state formal alliance believed possible order al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri deal militant group would strengthen islamist force syria air strike cripple isi funding source equipment store slow advance u said al nusra targeted plane attacked new group called khorasan analyst suspect part al nusra two group known co operate khorasan believed made veteran al qaeda fighter battlefield experience mostly pakistan afghanistan britain u united nation among classed al nusra terrorist group citing use suicide bombing terrorist attack attempt impose islamic law small number anti government group including member secular free syrian army opposed label al nusra gained respect fighting assad regime,isi fighter reportedly one mile away baghdad report emerge al qaeda militant bolstering rank syria according foundation relief reconciliation middle east isi approaching iraqi capital monday morning report emerge al qaeda militant bolstering rank syria according foundation relief reconciliation middle east isi approaching iraqi capital monday morning report independent islamic state le km away entering baghdad spokesperson said could never happen almost obama
163,"In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.

According to a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin’s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, “It’s almost done, if not signed already, but it’s essentially a done deal.”

If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers – particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasn’t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.

According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple’s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn’t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook’s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.

Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.

Apple’s re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, it’s unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apple’s one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. It’s certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple’s messaging platform, but it’s unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.

Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for today’s Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.

Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr — Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014

Apple has been known to be a fan of Morin’s, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the company’s decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldn’t be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morin’s seating at today’s event and Apple’s long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years.

To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It’s certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didn’t have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin’s vaunted reputation for design, and Apple’s social struggles I can’t think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Don’t be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.

Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim.

164,"Islamic State terrorists couldn’t strike ransom deals with the United States to trade hostages for money — so their newest revenue drive has them attempting to sell the body of James Foley, one of their beheaded victims.

Several sources for the Islamic State told BuzzFeed News that middlemen have been trying to strike a sale, with the asking price for Foley’s remains at $1 million.

One small company makes the gadget possible, and its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run.
Foley, a U.S. journalist and long-time hostage, was the first of a series of public and videotaped Islamic State beheadings of Western citizens. He was killed in August.

Islamic State terrorists say they’ll transport his body to Turkey — and that they’ll even give a DNA sample to prove the remains belong to Foley, BuzzFeed News reported.

Islamic State terrorists reportedly held 23 hostages from the West earlier this year. Fifteen Europeans were freed after the group received millions of dollars in ransom payments. American and Britain hostages, however, were not among the ransomed.

BuzzFeed News said three sources with contact with Islamic State members confirmed that Foley’s body was being put up for sale. One is a former Syrian rebel fighter with ties to Islamic State leaders, BuzzFeed News said.



“They ask for $1 million and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” he said, BuzzFeed News reported. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

165,"A FIVE-YEAR-OLD boy has been billed with a ""no show fee"" - for missing his friend's BIRTHDAY party.

Derek Nash and his partner discovered the invoice - for the sum of £15.95 - after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

The host of the party gave it to Alex via a teacher after he failed to show up for the get-together at a ski slope and snowboard centre in Plymouth, Cornwall.

Alex's family confirmed that their son would be attending the party just before the Christmas holidays.

But Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He then asked Alex if he wished to join his sister or go to the party, to which he chose to spend time with his grandparents.

Bemused Mr Nash said he originally thought the invoice ""was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved and now the birthday boy's mother has threatened to take him to a small claims court.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.""

However, after Alex had changed his mind about the party, Ms Nash realised he had no way of contacting the birthday boy's mother.

""So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents,"" he said.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but just over a week later, the family were stunned to receive the bill.

Mr Nash continued: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for 15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

""I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her. She said, 'Yes, a brown envelope'.

""I then visited Alex's school headteacher, who couldn't apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

""She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.""

He then went to visit the mother, since named as Julie Lawrence and whose address was on the invoice, and told her that he would not be paying the bill.

""I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son's school bag,"" he said.

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

The mother has since threatened the family to take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Mr Nash added: ""I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

""They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.""

His partner, who does not want to be named, has been in contact with the mum on Facebook and is hoping to resolve the situation.

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said she had no regrets about sending the invoice.

She said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Manager of the Plymouth ski and snowboard centre, Louisa Duggan, said they would never send invoices to individuals and were upset at being dragged into the row.

She said: ""This is nothing to do with us. It is a dispute between two parents. But I really need to clarify that we don't send invoices to private individuals - ever.

""We don't know the names of the children coming so we would never even be able to.

""We are upset that we have been dragged into this. We ask families who book with us to pay a small deposit and then 48 hours before we ask them to confirm the numbers.

""This gives them plenty of time to get responses in. We are quite flexible if any of the party does not turn up.

""We can put on other activities to compensate or often an adult will take part in place.

""We do need to know how many people are coming because we have to plan food and reserve activities and spaces. That is how any businesses like ours has to operate.""",five year old boy billed show fee missing friend birthday party derek nash partner discovered invoice sum slipped son alex school bag host party gave alex via teacher failed show get together ski slope snowboard centre plymouth cornwall alex family confirmed son would attending party christmas holiday mr nash torpoint cornwall realised arranged daughter go day trip grandparent asked alex wished join sister go party chose spend time grandparent bemused mr nash said originally thought invoice joke issue remained unresolved birthday boy mother threatened take small claim court said saw asked alex coming party time agreed said alex looking forward however alex changed mind party m nash realised way contacting birthday boy mother day party asked alex wanted chose grandparent said time contact number email address let boy mother know alex returned torpoint nursery infant school january week later family stunned receive bill mr nash continued partner looked friend mother apologise alex showing party see january looked alex school bag found brown envelope invoice child party show fee asked alex class teacher child mother given anything said yes brown envelope visited alex school headteacher apologise enough one teacher passed said would remind staff breach protocol went visit mother since named julie lawrence whose address invoice told would paying bill told spoken first put invoice son school bag said would sympathised cost alex showing believe way gone around mother since threatened family take case small claim court birthday boy longer play alex school mr nash added drive around south west job talked quite people quite incredulous happened thought joke begin lost word partner want named contact mum facebook hoping resolve situation short statement m lawrence said regret sending invoice said detail party invite every detail needed contact manager plymouth ski snowboard centre louisa duggan said would never send invoice individual upset dragged row said nothing u dispute two parent really need clarify send invoice private individual ever know name child coming would never even able upset dragged ask family book u pay small deposit hour ask confirm number give plenty time get response quite flexible party turn put activity compensate often adult take part place need know many people coming plan food reserve activity space business like operate,billed show fee missing friend birthday party derek nash partner discovered invoice sum slipped son alex school bag host party gave alex via teacher failed show get together ski slope snowboard centre plymouth cornwall alex family confirmed son would attending party christmas holiday mr nash torpoint cornwall realised arranged daughter go day trip grandparent asked alex wanted chose grandparent said time contact number email address let boy mother know alex returned torpoint nursery infant school january week later family stunned receive
166,"This is the stuff nightmares are made of, but one teen took it all in her stride. Waking up in the middle of brain surgery sounds like a painful experience, but when this happened to 19-year-old Iga Jasica she didn’t feel a thing. The teen just asked the surgeons how the operation was going when she suddenly woke up on the table, according to Fox News on Jan. 3.

It is a mystery as to why the girl woke up during the delicate procedure while on the operating table in Poland. The doctors were shocked to hear her talk to them while they had her brain exposed mid-surgery. The hospital is looking into the possibility that the anesthesia was improperly administered.

Experts say that the procedure itself could have caused the teen to regain consciousness even with enough anesthesia on board to knock her out. Jasica chatted with the doctors a bit when she woke up during the surgery and apparently she had a lot to say. She brought up the subject of cats to the physicians who were literally working on her exposed brain, according to Sports Act today.

Even though the teen woke up enough to carry on a conversation, she was never in any pain or danger when this happened say doctors. Jasica was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain during this procedure, reports Headlines & Global News today. The doctors were about half-way through the operation when the teen woke up.

172,"A female Kurdish fighter, who has become the face of the Kurdish resistance fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to claim the town of Kobane, has been reportedly killed by the militant group, several media outlets claimed.

Rehana, a member of the Women’s Defense Unit, was reportedly beheaded by ISIS after a photo of her posing with a victory sign was tweeted by a journalist, Britain's Daily Mail reported.


In the same tweet, the journalist claimed that Rehana, the nom de guerre she adopted as per female Kurdish fighter tradition, had already killed 100 militants fighting with ISIS.

As the tweet was retweeted more than 5,000 times, she became the poster girl of Kurdish resistance in Kobane.

Reports of her death circulated on social media after a photo of an ISIS militant holding her severed head was reportedly shared on Twitter.

The People’s Defense Unit, or the YPG, are yet to make a comment about the allegations, the British daily said.

The YPG is the de facto army of the Kurdish regions of north and northeast Syria, is the armed wing of the powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD).

Kurdish women have been at the forefront in the battle against ISIS, as their numbers, already in the thousands, continues to grow.

According to Agence France-Presse, women traditionally form a major part of Kurdish fighting forces, and they are well represented among Kurdish forces in neighboring Turkey and Iraq.

On October 5, young Kurdish woman fighter Dilar Gencxemis, identified by the YPG by the nom-de-guerre of Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobane in an attack which reportedly killed dozens of IS militants.

The battle to claim Kobane has been raging for more than a month with fierce fighting between ISIS militants and Kurdish fighters backed by a an anti-ISIS U.S.-led coalition.

174,"Saudi Arabia's national airline plans to keep men and women apart after passengers objected to on-board gender mixing, the Emirates247 news website reported Wednesday.

""There are solutions to this problem,"" said Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, the assistant manager of national carrier Saudia. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,"" Saudi daily Ajel quoted him as saying.

The paper said flight staff at Saudi Arabia's airports would be instructed to keep men and women segregated on board Saudia planes, unless they are close relatives.

Complaints about mixed-gender sitting are also common on planes flying to Israel, with some ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refusing to sit next to unrelated women and some women objecting to being asked to move so that the men won't have to sit next to them.

A Delta flight from New York to Israel was delayed earlier this month when ultra-Orthodox passengers refused to sit between two women, Israel Radio reported on Friday.

A number of similar incidents were reported in the media earlier this year, bringing the controversial issue into the headlines. In some cases, the men reportedly offered to pay the female passengers to switch their seats.

In September, a petition on Change.org urged Israeli carrier El Al to stop allowing female passengers to be ""bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats.""

The publication, citing “people familiar with the matter,” said the split may be made public as early as tomorrow.

The Journal said that current CEO Meg Whitman will become CEO of the enterprise-oriented company, and independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman. Whitman will serve as chairman of the PC/printer firm, and exec Dion Weisler will be CEO.

HP has been struggling with its dual selves of being oriented toward businesses’ high-end needs and toward personal computers and printers. Various company executives have in the past discussed spinning off its PC unit, only to be followed by the company asserting its long-term interest in PCs.

In 2000, Agilent Technologies split off from HP, taking with it the test and measurement equipment business that was HP’s first line of business.

The company had long reigned as the top PC maker in the world, although it dropped to second place last year in the rankings of industry research firm IDC, after Lenovo. Its printer/personal systems group rakes in about $56 billion in fiscal 2013, about half the company’s total, but sales are down about seven percent from the previous year.

183,"The Islamic State (Isis) are attempting to sell the body of beheading victim James Foley for $1m (£638,000) to raise funds for their terrorist organisation, according to reports.

The group are said to be coming up with new ways to raise money following a series of failed hostage negotiations and are now hoping to sell the murdered journalist's body back to his family.

The group are willing to provide a DNA test to prove the body is Foley's before taking it across the border into Turkey once the ransom is paid, reported Buzzfeed News.

Foley was the first US citizen to be beheaded by IS on video, a move which was widely condemned as a ""shocking and depraved"" act. The 40-year-old journalist was taken hostage while reporting in Syria in November 2012.

Three middlemen with ties to IS – a former Syrian rebel fighter, a businessman, and an official for the Free Syrian Army (FSA) – said the group believe the act of handing over the body is a ""humanity case"" to help give the family closure.

The former rebel said: ""They ask for $1m, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first. They will not give the DNA without the money.""

The other two sources are said to have backed up the $1m figure.

It was previously reported that IS demanded a $132m ransom for Foley while he was still alive, which the US government refused to pay as they were not willing to negotiate with the terrorist group.

The FSA official notes the issues raised if the US now purchase Foley's body after allegedly threatening his parents with prosecution if they paid the ransom themselves.

""It will be like a shame for the US government,"" the official said. ""People will ask why you brought the body but you didn't bring him when he was alive.""

Foley's family have not commented on the claims and the US State Department said they are ""seeking more information"".

According to the New York Times report by Rukmini Callimachi, hostage negotiations and ransom payments has earned al-Qaida and its affiliates more than $125m over a five-year period.

""Although every country in the world says they don't pay, the reality is that, in fact, it's really only the British government, the US government, the Canadians, and a few small European governments that don't pay,"" wrote Callimachi.

184,"Almost throughout the entire year we constantly heard rumors that Apple’s smartwatch will be released later this year. A couple of weeks back the Apple Watch was formally unveiled but the company also revealed that it won’t hit the market until early 2015. There has already been much speculation about why Apple missed its 2014 launch target for this wearable device but what most people are now interested is when it’ll finally be available? If recent reports are to be believed then Valentine’s Day 2015 may be the Apple Watch release target.
Every year Apple releases its new iPhones and iPads around the holiday season which is one of the most lucrative shopping seasons of the year. Probably why it was assumed from the very start that Apple’s smartwatch too would be released around the same time.
But recently rumors about production issues starting cropping up, hinting that the release may have been pushed back as a result of these delays. While Apple hasn’t confirmed if production issues really did play a part in pushing the smartwatch’s release into 2015 CEO Tim Cook did remark in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek that Apple “could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products.”
Valentine’s Day doesn’t see shopping frenzy that can rival the lucrative holiday season but its still that time of the year when people are a bit loose with their wallets. The Information reports on the possibility of Apple shipping the smartwatch by Valentine’s Day 2015 and 9to5mac has been hearing whispers about the same, still there no confirmation on this from Cupertino.

191,"A heartwarming letter of support written by a nine-year-old to her primary school teacher has swept the internet.

The British student wrote the tearjerker note after the teacher told her class that he was gay.

The man, who has preferred to stay anonymous, told the website PinkNews that he decided to come out to his pupils after learning that all of the class had heard the word 'gay' used as an insult.

The note that a British student wrote to her teacher after he told her class that he was gay. The man came out after learning every pupil had heard 'gay' used as an insult

He was stunned to receive the letter from the child afterwards, which described him as 'fantastic and awesome.'

It read in full: 'Dear Mr R

'Even though you're gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now.

'I still think about you the same way as I used to.

'You're a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

'The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

'You don't have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

'From A x x

'PS. We are all proud of you'

The teacher then shared the letter on social media.

He told PinkNews: 'As a primary school teacher, I'd always worried about mentioning my sexuality, despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands, wives and significant others all the time.

'Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I'd asked who'd heard 'gay' being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.'

The teacher, who preferred to stay anonymous, said that he welled up after reading the letter (picture posed by models)

He continued: 'Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.

'After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I'm gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they're talking about me.'

'The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.

'The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments.

'Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, 'It's just your life'. Then she went back to her maths.

'For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow-up, just acceptance.

'Now, I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better.

202,"A JILTED wife faces jail after chopping off her cheating husband's manhood… TWICE.

Unfaithful husband Fan Lung was rumbled after he sent a saucy message to his younger lover Zhang Hung, from his wife's mobile phone.

Angry Feng later discovered the steamy message, as well as several others , on her smartphone after her husband neglected to log-out of his email account.

In a fit of rage and clutching a pair of scissors, Feng burst into the couple's bedroom where father-of-five Lung was sleeping.

She then sliced off his genitals.

Fan was rushed to hospital where doctors successfully sewed his appendage back in place.

However, while he was recovering from the operation, his still-angry wife stormed into the hospital room with a pair of scissors and repeated the attack.

Fuming Feng cut away the fresh stitches before throwing her husband's manhood out of a window.

""The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,"" said a hospital spokesperson.

""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

""He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.""

Medical staff, with a helping hand from some local police officers, carefully combed the area outside the hospital in search of Fan's penis.

However the search proved unsuccessful, with some officers speculating the missing manhood may have been stolen by a stray dog or cat.

The spokesperson added: ""The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

""He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.""

Fan's mistress Zhang, 21, who has visited her lover in hospital since the incident, claimed she plans to marry the dad-of-five despite the traumatic incident.

""It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,"" she said.

207,"NEW YORK, New York -

Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.

In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.

“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”

In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”

When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”",new york new york vladimir kershov publicist r b singer bruno mar fired today revealed shocking secret regarding pop r b singer kershov leaked private information revealed michael jackson mar biological father statement emailed news medium outlet across world kershov revealed told singer dna testing proven jackson known across world king pop without doubt biological father pleading mar born name peter hernandez go public revelation mar refused kershov insisted made known public news would catapult singer fame boost record sale mar remained adamant information released according kershov took upon emailed shocking news medium source world dna testing proven michael jackson biological father bruno mar kershov said statement wish decided relay message greater good betterment bruno life extravagant music career statement released mar new publicist jacqueline pryor announced kershov immediately fired singer may seek legal action former publicist job publicist indeed better career client persuading take part thing cause popularity grow however client must trust publicist artist final say matter asked validity kershov statement pryor surprisingly made clear information accurate true mean right saying true come year old bruno mar michael jackson father,kershov publicist bruno mar fired today revealed shocking secret regarding pop r b singer bruno mar leaked private information revealed michael jackson mar biological father statement emailed news medium outlet across world kershov revealed dna testing proven michael jackson known across world king pop without doubt biological father pleading mar born name peter hernandez go public revelation mar refused kershov insisted made known public news would catapult singer fame boost record sale mar
211,"Update at 5:38 p.m.

Did Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner take on a godson? Yes. Did she do it, as we and others reported, because of the legend of the werewolf? No.

The Guardian reports that a tradition that began during mass Russian immigration to Argentina in the early 20th century became conflated with a local legend involving seventh sons and werewolves.

""The local myth of the [lobison] is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son [or seventh daughter] born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the newspaper.

The emigres from Russia who asked the Argentine president in 1907 to become the godfather to their seventh son were carrying on a custom from czarist Russia. The practice became law in 1974.

Our original post is below:

Silver bullets are believed to be among the few effective weapons against werewolves. In Argentina, add presidential protection to that short list.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, in keeping with a long-standing tradition, has embraced a 21-year-old Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from assuming a lycanthropic form.

The root of the story is the mythology of the Guarani people that says the seventh son in a family of only male children will turn into el lobison — a werewolf. This legend prompted some people to abandon — or kill — their seventh-born sons. So Argentina passed a law in the 1920s that gave the seventh son presidential protection along with a gold medal and a scholarship until his 21st birthday.

At first, that law covered only Catholic families. But in 2009, a presidential decree broadened the law to cover children of other faiths, too.

Kirchner's godson is Yair Tawil, the seventh son of a rabbi, and he's the first Jewish godson of an Argentine president.

The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports:

Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office in Buenos Aires. They lit Hanukkah candles on a menorah the family presented her. Kirchner publicized the event on Twitter, calling the meeting ""magical"" and the Tawil family ""marvelous.""",update p argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner take godson yes others reported legend werewolf guardian report tradition began mass russian immigration argentina early th century became conflated local legend involving seventh son werewolf local myth lobison way connected custom began year ago every seventh son seventh daughter born argentina becomes godchild president argentine historian daniel balmaceda told newspaper emigre russia asked argentine president become godfather seventh son carrying custom czarist russia practice became law original post silver bullet believed among effective weapon werewolf argentina add presidential protection short list president cristina fernandez de kirchner keeping long standing tradition embraced year old jewish man godson prevent assuming lycanthropic form root story mythology guarani people say seventh son family male child turn el lobison werewolf legend prompted people abandon kill seventh born son argentina passed law gave seventh son presidential protection along gold medal scholarship st birthday first law covered catholic family presidential decree broadened law cover child faith kirchner godson yair tawil seventh son rabbi first jewish godson argentine president jewish telegraphic agency report fernandez received yair parent three brother office buenos aire lit hanukkah candle menorah family presented kirchner publicized event twitter calling meeting magical tawil family marvelous,argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner take godson yes others reported legend werewolf guardian report tradition began mass russian immigration argentina early th century became law conflated local legend involving seventh son werewolf local myth lobison way connected custom began year ago every seventh son seventh daughter born argentina becomes godchild president argentine historian daniel balmaceda told newspaper emigre russia asked argentine president become

A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.

An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center.

Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later.

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures...nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.",cnn cardiac arrest leading joan river death happened comedian personal doctor began performing biopsy vocal cord source close death investigation told cnn joan river year joan river blurb joan river passed away age take look life legendary comedienne celebrity pay tribute joan river joan river last show celebrity took social medium share thought comedian joan river death take look tribute posted twitter staff member manhattan yorkville endoscopy clinic told investigator doctor publicly identified took selfie photo procedure room river anesthesia source said river clinic scheduled endoscopy another doctor gastroenterologist dr lawrence cohen procedure intended help diagnose hoarse voice sore throat involved insertion camera throat cohen clinic medical director finished work biopsy done river without prior consent according source ear nose throat specialist certified clinic required law performed biopsy vocal cord doctor described source river personal ear nose throat physician even though licensed physician still check balance get approval practice particular place said dr arthur caplan medical ethicist new york university langone medical center investigator believe river vocal chord began swell allegedly unauthorized biopsy cutting flow oxygen lung led cardiac arrest morning august source said river rushed paramedic yorkville endoscopy new york mount sinai hospital mile away died week later yorkville endoscopy issued statement last thursday denying report vocal cord biopsy ever done clinic although federal privacy law prevented patient information released day denial issued clinic confirmed dr cohen currently performing procedure currently serving medical director source said time neither cohen ear nose throat doctor accused wrongdoing investigator clinic declined respond source comment biopsy selfie citing federal privacy law,joan river death happened comedian personal doctor began performing biopsy vocal cord source close death investigation told cnn joan river year joan river blurb joan river passed away age take look life legendary comedienne celebrity pay tribute joan river joan river last show celebrity took social medium share thought comedian joan river death take look tribute posted twitter staff member manhattan yorkville endoscopy clinic told investigator doctor publicly identified took selfie photo procedure room river anesthesia source said river clinic scheduled endos
216,"Pictures of Britain's so-called biggest crustacean, dubbed Crabzilla, have emerged in Whitstable.

Aerial images of what is said to be a giant sea creature have appeared on supernatural website Weird Whitstable set up by Station Road artist Quinton Winter.

But it has left doubters racking their brains as to how the image might have been created - and how likely such a huge shellfish is in our waters.

Crabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water
The shadowy figure has been estimated to be 50ft long as it dwarfs fishing boats resting on the pier.

According to the website, the discovery was made in July last year in a popular crabbing spot by two young boys.

Is this the Britain's biggest crustacean?
The website reads: ""This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend.

""The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.""

But graphic artist Ashley Austen remained sceptical.

He said: ""The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop.

""All the 'artist' had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.""

Tens of thousands of people, mainly students, have brought central Hong Kong to a standstill, blocking roads and forcing the closure of banks and schools, in a major pushback against Beijing's decision to limit democratic reforms.

The uprising is fast becoming known as the 'Umbrella Revolution' due to the fact that protesters are using little more than parasols to protect themselves against the volleys of tear gas being fired at them by police - in an unprecedented crack down on dissent - leaving many choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour.

The protesters have in turn countered with the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture, first employed last month by demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. There, the gesture became a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America.

'Hands up, don't shoot': Protesters have responded to the government's use of tear gas by using the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture first employed by demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, last month as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown

Toxic fumes: Fury continues to grow over the police's heavy-handed attempts to disperse protesters, including the widespread use of tear gas

Appropriation: Protesters in Hong Kong have appropriated the gesture, which came to symbolise the fight against racism and police violence in America, as a symbol of democracy and freedom

Their use of the gesture has been hailed as a sign of how 'plugged in' to world affairs Hong Kongers are despite the mainland government's attempts to stifle social media and other information-gathering tools

And this morning, the Chinese government announced that riot police had been taken off the streets as citizens 'have mostly calmed down' and urged people to unblock roads and disperse.

Instead, the government switched its focus to social media, banning Instagram across the country in a further bid to stifle dissent in the Asian financial hub.

The popular photo-sharing service was shut down today in an apparent attempt to prevent demonstrators sharing photographs of the upheaval with their countrymen, as they expanded their rallies throughout Hong Kong.

Many photos already posted on the image-sharing website - labelled under the hashtag #OccupyCentral, a phrase officials went on to block from Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

Resistance: Thousands of protesters are still gathered in Hong Kong's financial district despite police throwing tear gas at them and launching a baton charge

Heavy-handed: Many photos already posted on the image-sharing website - labelled under the hashtag #OccupyCentral - show police firing tear gas canisters into crowds leaving protesters choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour

The social media crack down comes as police officers tried to negotiate with protesters, some wearing surgical masks and holding up umbrellas to protect against tear gas, camped out on a normally busy highway near the Hong Kong government headquarters that was the scene of impassioned clashes that erupted the evening before.

An officer with a bullhorn tried to get them to clear the way for the commuters. A protester, using the group's own speaker system, responded by saying that they wanted Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to demand a genuine choice for the territory's voters.

'Do something good for Hong Kong. We want real democracy!' he shouted.

As the mayhem continued, London-based banks HSBC and Standard Chartered were today forced to shut bank branches in Hong Kong as the territory's political unrest spills into the financial markets as the Hang Seng stock market to fall 2 per cent to a two-month low.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Office confirmed it is carefully monitoring the situation with a spokesman saying the British Government was 'concerned' about the events there and highlighted people's right to protest.

Nap time: Policemen rest following pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong after tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators brought parts of central Hong Kong to a standstill in a dramatic escalation of protests that have gripped the semi-autonomous Chinese city for days

He went on: 'It is Britain's long-standing position, as a co-signatory of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, that Hong Kong's prosperity and security are underpinned by its fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to demonstrate.

'It is important for Hong Kong to preserve these rights and for Hong Kong people to exercise them within the law.

'These freedoms are best guaranteed by the transition to universal suffrage.

'We hope that the upcoming consultation period will produce arrangements which allow a meaningful advance for democracy in Hong Kong, and we encourage all parties to engage constructively in discussion to that end.'

Hands up: Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, adopted the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture after claims Mike Brown had his arms in the air when he was shot by a police officer in the city

Defiance: The clashes - images of which have been beamed around the world - are undermining Hong Kong's image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping's government

Anger: Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west

Force: The authorities have threatened to increase their use of force if the student activists, who are demanding democratic elections, do not disperse

Disruption: The protest marks the end of a week of activities which has become the worst unrest in Hong Kong since Britain handed the province back to China

Gas: Officers used tear gas to break up the protest for the first time in Hong Kong since 2005, though officers denied rumours they had also fired rubber bullets

China has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government's crackdown. The clashes - images of which have been beamed around the world - are undermining Hong Kong's image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping's government. Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west.

The mass protests are the strongest challenge yet to Beijing's decision last month to reject open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first-ever elections for Hong Kong's leader, promised for 2017. Instead, candidates must continue to be hand-picked by Beijing - a move that many residents viewed as reneging on promises to allow greater democracy in the semi-autonomous territory.

With rumours swirling, the Beijing-backed and deeply unpopular Leung reassured the public that speculation that the Chinese army might intervene was untrue.

'I hope the public will keep calm. Don't be misled by the rumors. Police will strive to maintain social order, including ensuring smooth traffic and ensuring the public safety,' Leung said. 'When they carry out their duties, they will use their maximum discretion.'

Democracy: The students are demanding a free vote in upcoming elections after the Chinese government hand-picked candidates loyal to the regime

Protection: Protesters wearing home-made gas masks and goggle throw tear gas grenades back at police as they demand democratic elections in Hong Kong

Unlawful: Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung has said authorities will do whatever is necessary to break up the protest, which he said were illegal

Violent: An officer holding a riot shield shouts at protesters during a second day of demonstrations in Hong Kong where police have clashed with activists

The protest has been spearheaded largely but student-age activists but has gathered momentum among a broad range of people from high school students to the elderly.

Protesters also occupied streets in other parts of Hong Kong Island, including the upscale shopping area of Causeway Bay as well as across the harbor in densely populated Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula. The city's transport department said roads in those areas were closed.

More than 200 bus routes have been canceled or diverted in a city dependent on public transport. Subway exits have also been closed or blocked near protest area. Authorities said some schools in areas near the main protest site would be closed.

Leung urged people to go home, obey the law and avoid causing trouble.

'We don't want Hong Kong to be messy,' he said as he read a statement that was broadcast early Monday.

Arrests: While police have dispersed many of the protesters there are still thousands from the Occupy Central group gathered in the city's financial district

Protest: It is believed that the city's financial district will try to operate as normal tomorrow, despite thousands of protesters camped in the street

Crowd control: Riot police prepare to defend the Hong Kong government complex, although it was later reported that some protesters had made it inside

Standoff: Protesters have now erected barricades in the centre of Hong Kong and are preparing to settle in for the night as riot police surround them

Unrest: The night of demonstrations follows on from clashes between activists and police yesterday when students charged through a cordon and broke into the Hong Kong government complex

That came hours after police lobbed canisters of tear gas into the crowd on Sunday evening. The searing fumes sent demonstrators fleeing, though many came right back to continue their protest. The government said 26 people were taken to hospitals.

To ward off tear gas, demonstrators improvised with homemade defenses such as plastic wrap, which they used to cover their face and arms, as well as umbrellas, goggles and surgical masks.

The protests began with a class boycott last week by students urging Beijing to grant genuine democratic reforms to this former British colony.

'This is a long fight,' business and law student Edward Yau, 19, said overnight. 'The government has to understand that we have the ability to undo it if they continue to treat us like we are terrorists.'

When China took control of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, it agreed to a policy of 'one country, two systems' that allowed the city a high degree of control over its own affairs and kept in place liberties unseen on the mainland. It also promised the city's leader would eventually be chosen through 'universal suffrage.'

Hong Kong's residents have long felt their city stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems.

Beijing's insistence on using a committee to screen candidates on the basis of their patriotism to China - similar to the one that currently hand-picks Hong Kong's leaders - has stoked fears among pro-democracy groups that Hong Kong will never get genuine democracy.

University students began their class boycotts over a week ago and say they will continue them until officials meet their demands for reforming the local legislature and withdrawing the proposal to screen election candidates.

Students and activists had been camped out since late Friday on streets outside the government complex. Sunday's clashes arose when police sought to block thousands of people from entering the protest zone. Protesters spilled onto a busy highway, bringing traffic to a standstill.

As night fell hundreds had returned to the scene with protective eyewear and waterproof ponchos in the fear that more tear gas will be distributed tonight

In a statement issued after midnight, the Hong Kong police said rumors that they had used rubber bullets to try to disperse protesters were 'totally untrue.'

Police in blue jumpsuits, wearing helmets and respirators, doused protesters with pepper spray when they tried to rip metal barricades apart.

Thousands of people breached a police cordon Sunday as they tried to join the sit-in, spilling out onto a busy highway and bringing traffic to a standstill.

Although students started the rally, leaders of the broader Occupy Central civil disobedience movement joined them early Sunday, saying they wanted to kick-start a long-threatened mass sit-in demanding Hong Kong's top leader be elected without Beijing's interference.

Occupy Central issued a statement Monday calling on Leung to resign and saying his 'non-response to the people's demands has driven Hong Kong into a crisis of disorder.' The statement added that the protest was now 'a spontaneous movement' of all Hong Kong people.

Police said they had arrested 78 people. They also took away several pro-democracy legislators who were among the demonstrators, but later released them.

A police statement said the officers 'have exercised restraint and performed their duties in a highly professional manner.' It urged the public to not occupy roads so that emergency vehicles can get through.

Among the dozens arrested was 17-year-old Joshua Wong, who was dragged away soon after he led a group of students storming the government complex. Wong is a leader of the activist group Scholarism, which organized protests two years ago that forced the government to drop proposed Chinese national curriculum guidelines seen as brainwashing. He was released Sunday evening.

223,"The appearance of Path founder Dave Morin in the front row of Tuesday's iPhone 6 launch event has added credibility to a Pando report that says Apple is about to acquire the struggling social network. Morin tweeted a selfie of him and Dr Dre, who has previously occupied the front row slot. Dre's Beats Entertainment was Apple's last acquisition.

Pando writes:

According to a single well-placed source inside Apple's engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin's Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, ""It's almost done, if not signed already, but it's essentially a done deal.""

Until recently, Path was all but written off by most people. The social network - which limits users to an exclusive ring of just 150 friends - laid off 20% of its staff a year ago and has gathered only 25 million users.

More recently, Morin told BuzzFeed that Path ""maybe"" failed:

""Did the experiment fail? Maybe,"" he told BuzzFeed News. ""Are we trying to take new approaches to the interface and approach it different ways than we did before? Absolutely. ... I think failure is a big part of life and being human the best thing we can do is keep moving forward.""

Pando reports that Path's social network function might by incorporated into a revamped Messages app.

231,"Joan Rivers' doctor took a selfie with the unconscious comedian in the operating room before her endoscopy, according to a new report from CNN. The ear, nose and throat specialist, who hasn't been publicly identified, was also allowed to perform a biopsy on her vocal cords, a procedure that Rivers hadn't previously approved and which may have led to her cardiac arrest.

Citing ""a source close to the death investigation,"" CNN reports that the doctor was allowed into the operating room at Yorkville Endoscopy, although he wasn't affiliated with the clinic in any way. While there, the source added, he ""took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia."" After Dr. Lawrence Cohen, medical director of Yorkville, finished performing the procedure on Rivers, he stepped aside and allowed the ear nose and throat specialist to biopsy her vocal cords. During that procedure, CNN says, her vocal cords ""began to swell,"" cutting off oxygen to her lungs and leading to her cardiac arrest.

Yorkville Endoscopy previously released a statement denying that Rivers' vocal cords were being biopsied  when she went into cardiac arrest. The statement didn't address reports that Rivers' personal doctor was allowed in the operating room. Yorkville's medical director, Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was performing the endoscopy on Rivers, has already stepped down from his position. Neither he nor Rivers' doctor have been accused of any wrongdoing by the state Health Department officials investigating Rivers' death.

233,"Never has the saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' been more fitting than when a jilted wife in China chopped off her cheating husband's penis... twice.

When Feng Lung, 30, discovered her husband was having an affair she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors, then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it.

She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm.

Fan Lung (right) turned on his wife (left) after she cut off his penis for a second time and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital

Two-timing dad-of-five Fan Lung, 32, had used his wife's mobile to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu in central China's Henan province.

But after forgetting to log out of his account, stunned wife Feng came across the message and several others, and flew into a rage.

Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis.

Surgeons were able to reattach it, but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital.

A hospital spokesman said: 'The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital.

'Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

'He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.'

Lover: Zhang Hung (left) visited Fan (right) in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman said: 'The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

'He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.'

Fan's lover, who visited him at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

'It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,' Zhang said.

Xue Paan, 37, now faces jail time following her sadistic punishment of her nephew Qiang Qiang, who she was looking after while his mother visited a neighbour in the Henan Province in central China.

Xue was reportedly using her phone on the toilet when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on the device.

She was so angered by this that she took a blunt kitchen knife and cut his penis off with it, then fled the house before her sister, Qiang’s mother, returned.

Mother Cai Tuan, 27, immediately ran back to the house after hearing her child scream.

‘Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood. Next to him was a knife and his penis. It was simply horrific,’ she said.

The boy’s parents rushed him to a hospital where surgeons were able to reattach the appendage, before transporting him to a specialist clinic in Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said the knife was ‘quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment’.

Following three surgeries in total, hospital workers are now confident the young boy’s penis will work properly and he should suffer only minor side effects from the attack.

His aunt was tracked down and arrested, and police say she now faces five years in prison for the horrific attack.

238,"A teenage girl in Poland woke up during brain surgery and asked her doctors how the operation was going, The Daily Mirror reported.

Iga Jasica, 19, had been undergoing the procedure to have a cancerous growth removed from her brain. Doctors say she woke up halfway through the surgery when the anesthetic wore off. Her brain was exposed, but surgeons say the southwest Polish girl’s health was not in jeopardy.

“Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” neurosurgeon Dawid Larysz told The Daily Mirror. He added that Jasica wouldn’t have been able to see or feel anything. Jasica doesn’t remember waking up during the surgery.

Doctors are investigating whether the anesthetic may have been improperly administered. Other experts told The Daily Mirror that the operation itself could have triggered her waking up despite the anesthetic.

While chatting with doctors during the procedure, Jasica reportedly brought up cats. After the surgery, she reflected on the experience.

“I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had, as I am now feeling great,” Jasica told The Daily Mirror when the procedure was complete.

245,"Saudia, the national airline, is said to be planning to ensure men and women are seated apart on its aeroplanes

The national airline of Saudi Arabia could be set to segregate sexes on board its flights amid claims men have lodged complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives.

Saudia will order staff to keep men and women seated apart on its aeroplanes unless they are close relatives, according the news website Emirates247.

Speaking to the Saudi daily, Ajel, assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, said: ""There are solutions to this problem, we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The airline carrier already complies with strict Islam practices including not serving alcohol or pork products, providing a men's prayer area on most international flights and not employing Saudi women as cabin crew.

But the airline does employ women of other nationalities.

Many Saudi women require approval from a male guardian before they can travel or work outside the home.

The vast majority of Gulf operated airlines abide by Islamic laws but vary in their strictness.

246,"So much for Tesla bringing its $5-billion battery factory to southern Dallas County.
According to The Wall Street Journal the company has decided to take its operations to Nevada. A press conference is allegedly scheduled in Carson City tomorrow.

Per MarketWatch: “Tesla said last month it had broken ground on a site in Storey County, east of Reno, but added that it will still be looking at other sites in other states as a final location would depend on what agreements and incentives it could get from whichever state it chooses.”

In July Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson said the company was “looking at a bunch of different locations and have not confirmed anything.” But in recent days and weeks it became increasingly clear Nevada was the clear favorite.

Earlier this week the Associated Press broke down the incentives that could have been offered by some of the contenders, Texas among them. (California, Arizona and New Mexico were also on the short list.) But Nevada had some significant advantages, among them: proximity to the assembly plant in Fremont, California, where Tesla makes its cars; significant deposit of lithium, which is essential to making the batteries,” said the AP report.

“That’s a go, but they are still negotiating the specifics of the contract,” a source within the Nevada’s governor’s office told CNBC.com Wednesday concerning tomorrow’s alleged announcement. CNBC reported that the source noted it could be a week before the deal is official. It’s expected to bring with it 6,500 jobs.

Of course, Texas had a few things working in its favor — chief among them, this is a right-to-work state. But CEO Elon Musk doesn’t care for Texas’ laws that prevent Tesla from selling its car directly to customers without first passing through a dealership.

248,"(CNN) -- The mother of James Foley -- an American journalist beheaded by ISIS militants -- said she is ""embarrassed and appalled"" by how the U.S. government dealt with her son's case, telling CNN that officials even suggested family members could be charged if they raised ransom to free him.

""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance"" to the U.S. government, Diane Foley told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Thursday. ""It didn't seem to be in (U.S.) strategic interest, if you will.""

Officials told Foley family members ""not go to the media,"" and that the ""government would not exchange prisoners,"" or carry out ""military action"" to try to rescue her son, according to Diane Foley.

""Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,"" Diane Foley said. ""As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.""

She added that the family was told many times that raising ransom ""was illegal (and) we might be prosecuted.""

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" Foley's mother told CNN. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

In fact, video posted online on August 19 showed James Foley kneeling next to a man dressed in black, with Foley reading a presumably scripted message that his ""real killer"" is America, then being summarily executed.

ISIS -- the Islamist extremist group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and threatening more killings.

'Our government needs to be ... willing to negotiate'

More than three weeks later, U.S. President Barack Obama named Foley as he outlined his strategy for fighting ISIS and described the terrorist group's brutality.

""They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff,"" Obama said in a televised address Wednesday night.

As she watched the speech, Diane Foley said one thing was going through her mind.

""This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death,"" she said. ""I guess all I'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder, smarter, willing to negotiate with these people who hate us, so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror.""

'He was compelled to bear witness'

After her son's death, Diane Foley wrote on the Free James Foley Facebook page that ""we have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.""

Sometimes, she said Thursday, it was tough for his family to deal with his decisions to report in dangerous parts of the world.

""At times, even his siblings were angered that he would return after his captivity in Libya. I mean, it was hard as a family to understand, because Jim was so loved ... and we were selfish. We wanted him with us. We wanted him safe,"" she said. ""But Jim was not. Jim was selfless, and he had the courage and the compassion. ... He was compelled to bear witness.""

To this end, his family launched a foundation -- the James W. Foley Legacy Fund -- aimed at helping families of American hostages, supporting U.S. journalists in war zones and helping urban youth in educational endeavors.

The organization is one way the Foley family is trying to honor James' past and do something positive in the future. But none of it takes away Diane Foley's disappointment that more wasn't done -- especially by the U.S. government -- to secure his release, somehow, since his November 22, 2012, disappearance in northwest Syria. At the time he was working for U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost.

""Jim would have been saddened"" by the U.S. government's efforts in the years after his abduction, his mother told CNN. ""Jim believed, till the end, that his country would come to (his) aid.""

A failed rescue operation

Upon hearing these comments, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing ""an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely"" -- said she ""and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could.""

Rice also pointed out ""hundreds of American personnel"" were involved in a ""very daring and very well-executed rescue operation"" to free Foley and other captives, after getting what they hoped was ""actionable intelligence"" about the location of the hostages. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said elite U.S. commandos undertook this mission this summer inside Syria.

Official: U.S. commandos tried, failed to rescue hostages

""Unfortunately, they were no longer there,"" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. ""But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home.""

Diane Foley, though, said the rescue operation came ""very late.""

""Their location was known for more than a year,"" she said.

During her son's time in captivity, she said, it often seemed the family knew more about his whereabouts than the authorities.

""I did all I could,"" she said. ""I was unable to do enough.""

Lessons for the future

Now, Diane Foley says she thinks Washington should change its approach to cases like that of her son and Steven Sotloff, another American journalist beheaded by ISIS weeks after James Foley.

""I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made,"" she told CNN, ""and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.""

There should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups, she said.

""The risk is becoming higher and higher,"" she said, ""and I really feel that our country let Jim down.""

249,"Amid conflicting reports, an Islamic State (Isis) spokesperson has confirmed the militant group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been injured in a recent US air strike.

The US has not yet confirmed whether al-Baghdadi was among the wounded in the attack, but Iraqi security officials have been quoted as saying he was injured.

Nonetheless, Abu Mohammed Al-Adnani, an official spokesperson for the Sunni insurgent group, wrote on Twitter: ""The leader of the ISIL [IS] Abu Bakr al-Baghdad has been injured.

""Do you think the State of Khilafa will end by the death of the Caliphate? We assure for the State that the Amir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is fine and we ask his followers to pray for God for his safety.""

Some have questioned the credibility of the Twitter account.

The US air strike which took place in the IS-controlled city of Mosul was targeted at top leaders of the extremist organisation. Local officials in Mosul said more than 50 bodies were brought to a morgue following the US aerial bombardment.

""This strike demonstrates the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL [IS] terrorist network and the group's increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre, communicate and command,"" the US Central Command said.

The Iraqi State television reported that al-Baghdadi's top aide was also killed in the air strike but it could not be independently verified.

There were rumours earlier regarding al-Baghdadi's injury or death, however these turned out to be false.

250,"Michael Foley says the administration threatened him when the family tried to raise funds

'That's what really bothers me to the core,' he said

The government says paying ransom to terrorists only fuels more abductions but denied threatening the Foley family

The brother of James Foley said on Thursday that the Obama administration threatened him when he tried to raise funds for the slain journalist's release from the terrorist group that beheaded him.

'They were actually an impedance,' Foley told Fox News, referring to the government's role in rescuing his older brother, a photojournalist who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in Northern Syria in 2012. 'They got in our way... That's what really bothers me to the core.'

The U.S. follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for Americans kidnapped by them, arguing doing so only leads to more abductions.

James Foley's parents John and Diane Foley and his brother, Michael, speak to reporters about James' murder outside of their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, last month. Michael has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the Obama administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release

Captured and executed: James Foley was taken hostage on Thanksgiving, 2012, while working for GlobalPost in northern Syria and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on August 19

'We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they're at even greater risk,' White House spokesman John Earnest said.

Foley, however, said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brother's freedom.

'I was specifically threatened by the Department of State about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother,' he said. 'We were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down. We lost a lot of time.'

Michael Foley, at right, and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure James' release from the hands of his captors

In a separate interview with ABC News, his mother, Diane Foley, said a military officer working for the National Security Council told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom.

'We took it as a threat and it was appalling,' she said. 'Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try,'

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment, according to ABC.

Michael Foley also said in the interview the new military campaign the U.S. is pursuing to stop ISIS 'came too late for Jim.'

Strategy: President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time, along with expanded strikes in Iraq, as part of 'a steady, relentless effort' to root out Islamic State extremists

'I just hope it's not too late for others,' he said.

ISIS is still holding several hostages from Western and other countries.

Diane Foley earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the Obama administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group, saying, 'I really feel our country let Jim down.'

On the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS, Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity.

Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, she made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley, 40, and said 'Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.'

And in a thinly veiled attack on Obama's new strategy to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said, 'bombing caused Jim's death.'

'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' Foley said. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.'

Still grieving, Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son.

At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration's co-ordination with her family, Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4, only to raid the wrong base.

Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria, and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving, 2012.

On August 19, ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant, who told the camera in a British accent, that his 'real killer' was the United States.

Exactly two weeks later, another American journalist, Stephen Sotloff, was beheaded, apparently by the same man, who tells the camera, 'I'm back Obama'.

During the efforts to get James home, Mrs. Foley said she met good people, people who wanted to help, but was adamant that she didn't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame'.

Mrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States.

However, ultimately, she 'didn't feel that Jim was a priority.'

'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,' said Foley's mother to CNN. 'And he wasn't, was he?'

The US-led coalition unleashed airstrikes near the Iraqi city of Mosul targeting top jihadist militants but the fate of the Islamic State group's enigmatic leader remained unclear.

Claims swirled that hardline IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed in the attacks late Friday, but US officials could not confirm if he had even been present.

The news came after US President Barack Obama unveiled plans to send up to 1500 more US troops to Iraq to help battle the militants who have seized a large swathe of territory.

In fresh violence, some 33 people were killed in a wave of car bombings against Shiite areas in the capital Baghdad, highlighting again the security challenge facing Iraqis even within government-controlled zones.

US Central Command confirmed that coalition aircraft conducted a ""series of airstrikes"" against ""a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul"".

A convoy of 10 armoured vehicles from the group also known as ISIL was destroyed.

""We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,"" CENTCOM spokesman Patrick Ryder said in his statement.

A strike against Baghdadi, who has proclaimed himself the ""caliph"" of a state straddling Iraq and Syria, would be a major coup for the US-led coalition.

Washington has offered a $US10 million ($10.82 million) reward for his capture, and some analysts say he is increasingly seen as more powerful than al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri.

In a video posted online in July, purportedly the first known footage of Baghdadi, he ordered all Muslims to obey him during a Ramadan sermon in Mosul.

Al-Arabiya TV reported Baghdadi had been wounded, while a local Iraqi channel said one of his aides was killed.

Iraqi leaders said the new US military trainers who will aid its fight against jihadists are welcome, but come ""late"".

Ryder added the US-led strikes were a further sign of ""the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL terrorist network"".

The aim was to squeeze the group and ensure it had ""increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre, communicate and command"".

The new troops will roughly double the number of American soldiers already in the country and marks a deepening US commitment in the open-ended war.

""This step is a little late, but we welcome it,"" a statement from Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi's office said.

The government had requested that members of the international coalition help train and arm its forces, the statement said.

Multiple Iraqi army divisions collapsed in the early days of the jihadist northern offensive, leaving major units that need to be reconstituted.

256,"A 19-year-old woman woke up in the middle of brain surgery and was lucid enough to ask doctors how the surgery was going.

Iga Jasica, of Poland, was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice when, mid-surgery, the anesthetic wore off, mirror.co.uk reported.

Jasica, whose brain was exposed at the time she awoke, asked the docs how the surgery was going — then started chatting about cats.

“Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said.

It’s possible the surgery may have triggered something that woke her up, experts said — but doctors are also looking into whether the anesthesia was administered correctly.

Jasica later said: “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

257,"Just when Apple finally caved in and gave customers a long-overdue bigger screen with the launch of the iPhone 6, the rumor mill is buzzing with a supposed backtrack re-introducing a new phone with a return to a 4-inch display.

The rumor, which originated from a Taiwanese site, hinted that the phone would supposedly target women who find bigger phones too cumbersome for petite hands.

The original ""announcement"" was made by the Chinese language website Electronic Times on Dec. 3. The smaller phones would supposedly be designed for easy use with just one hand and are said to be ready for sale in the second half of 2015.
The news has to be taken with a grain of salt, according to observers. The iPhone 6, which was the company's first major step into the bigger screen size market, has been a huge success and revived Apple for many fans. Insiders say it is highly unlikely that it will backtrack on that trend for a smaller screen.

Still, others say that the rumor may not be as far-fetched as one would imagine. Last year's iPhone 5c was a flop and is on its way out, with the iPhone 5 not too far behind. In an effort to still retain some of the budget market, Apple may be truly looking into re-releasing smaller screens.

The rumor purports that Apple will be producing the 4-inch displays in response to customer surveys vying for a return to smaller phones.

Those who believe the release of small screen phones are possible are also speculating that Apple would be releasing a cheaper iPhone 6c, iPhone 6 mini, or perhaps even a redesign of the iPhone 5c.

In the meantime, it is expected that Apple will launch a new line of phones in conjunction with the much-anticipated Apple Watch in the early months of 2015. No word yet if the company will be adding an iPhone 6s or perhaps an iPhone 7 to their phone lineup, or if these rumored 4-inch display phones will even be launched.",apple finally caved gave customer long overdue bigger screen launch iphone rumor mill buzzing supposed backtrack introducing new phone return inch display rumor originated taiwanese site hinted phone would supposedly target woman find bigger phone cumbersome petite hand original announcement made chinese language website electronic time dec smaller phone would supposedly designed easy use one hand said ready sale second half news taken grain salt according observer iphone company first major step bigger screen size market huge success revived apple many fan insider say highly unlikely backtrack trend smaller screen still others say rumor may far fetched one would imagine last year iphone c flop way iphone far behind effort still retain budget market apple may truly looking releasing smaller screen rumor purport apple producing inch display response customer survey vying return smaller phone believe release small screen phone possible also speculating apple would releasing cheaper iphone c iphone mini perhaps even redesign iphone c meantime expected apple launch new line phone conjunction much anticipated apple watch early month word yet company adding iphone perhaps iphone phone lineup rumored inch display phone even launched,apple finally caved gave customer long overdue bigger screen launch iphone rumor mill buzzing supposed backtrack introducing new phone return inch display rumor originated taiwanese site hinted phone would target woman find bigger phone cumbersome petite hand original announcement made chinese language website electronic time dec smaller phone would supposedly designed easy use one hand said ready sale second half news taken grain salt according observer iphone company first major step bigger screen size market huge success revived apple many fan insider say highly
259,"Now, that is an awkward dinner conversation

A filmmaker in Peru seems to have come up with an ingenious solution to men sexually harassing women in the street — trick serial offenders into catcalling their own mothers.

Two moms are shown agreeing to be secretly filmed as they donned flattering disguises and strolled past their unwitting sons. After the men shout out sleazy comments, the women pull off their wigs and confront their red-faced boys with a very loud and very public rebuke.

One enraged mother is seen hitting her son over the head with her handbag.

261,"Well, this is about as shame-inducing as it gets.
A new viral video, produced by Everlast (yep, the boxing company), shows young men in Lima, Peru getting a big surprise during a catcall session. In a segment titled ""Harassing Your Mother,"" Everlast took a group of women and changed up their looks with makeup and wardrobe changes and then had them walk past their own sons. After the young men embarrassed themselves with offensive exclamations like ""tasty panties"" and ""Hello, piggy,"" the women revealed themselves.

As you can imagine, the resulting confrontations showed the sons backpedaling on their catcalls and the mothers giving a piece of their mind.

The tweet was retweeted over 1,000 times, was picked up by Page Six, Fox News, and other media outlets, and started Twitterers speculating over whether Bonet was fired from the show 24 years ago for more sinister reasons than originally thought. Et cetera.

If you’ve been on the internet, you know what happened next. “I can assure you that is not her Twitter account and I have had the account suspended,” Bonet’s manager Jillian Neal told The Wrap.

Bonet is not even on Twitter, though naturally some are speculating that Cosby had her account shut down.

270,"A group of twenty women armed with AK-47 assault rifles stare defiantly at a camera. Most appear to be civilians, although three of them are wearing military-style camouflage uniforms. One woman stands in front of the rest, her rifle aimed forward at waist level. The muzzle appears to have been taped over, possibly to keep dust out of the barrel.

On Twitter, Facebook and the Web, the women have been hailed as heroes in the fight against Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. “Nigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts,” read a typical tweet of the image this week.

The photograph has been circulating for some time. We found posts dating to 2013, but the image appears to have gone viral in April 2014, around the time that more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in Chibok. It has gained renewed currency since this month’s Baga massacre and the battle for the city of Maiduguri.

Boko Haram attack repelled by ‘armed women’

Many of the more recent tweets link to a fringe news website, Countercurrentnews.com, and a post dated 27 May 2014. The photo is prominently displayed. “Another Boko Haram attack repelled by armed women,” reads the headline.

“Several Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists,” the article continues.

“The notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.”

‘Get ‘em ladies’

Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 9.40.33 AMA pro-gun Facebook page in the United States that calls itself “Hypocrisy and Stupidity of Gun Control Advocates” has also appropriated the photo, suggesting that it shows a group of Nigerian teachers.

It posted the image on 20 January 2015, along with this caption: “When Boko Haram showed up to kill and rape us and our students we didn’t hide or throw spaghetti-os…We shot them in the face because we don’t ‘demand’ action – we take action.”

The picture was shared more than 400 times and by 30 January 2015, just over 1,200 Facebook users had “liked” it. “You get ’em ladies,” wrote one. “I find their lack of belt fed weapons and RPGs troubling,” said another. “Face shooting is definitely the way to go,” added a third.

Solving a mystery

We were intrigued. Where was the photograph taken? What had happened? Who were the women? Were they teachers? Villagers? Vigilantes? We decided to do a little cyber-sleuthing.

The first clue was a green, yellow and red football shirt worn by a woman in the back row. The second was a bright blue dress worn by another woman with white patches bearing a symbol in similar shades of green, yellow and red. Could they be colours of a national flag?

The Nigerian flag is green and white. The flag of neighbouring Benin is green, yellow and red but not all the bands run parallel. The colours also appear in Mali’s flag. Usually they run vertically, not horizontally, as they do in the football shirt. But a Google search for images of “Mali football jersey” produced photos of football shirts strikingly similar to that worn by the woman in the back row.

Verifying images

Two invaluable tools that we regularly use at Africa Check to establish the veracity of photos circulating online are Google’s image search function and the “reverse image search” engine, Tineye-com. (For more tips, check out our guide to spotting online fakes and hoaxes.)

We uploaded the image to Google. The results weren’t encouraging. There were dozens of links to web pages, Facebook posts and tweets all claiming that the photograph showed armed Nigerian women who had fought off Boko Haram. None offered any details of where the picture had been taken and who had taken it.

In fact, the image had been so widely published in relation to Boko Haram that Google’s suggested search term after we uploaded it was “boko haram women”.

We changed the search term to “Mali” and hit enter.

The claim is a hoax

As it turns out, our hunch was correct. The photo was first published on 23 November, 2012 in The Times of London. It had been taken by a Times photographer, Jack Hill, in the town of Sevare in Mali and accompanied an article by one of the newspaper’s correspondents, Jerome Starkey, about “women bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali”.

The women – all members of the Ganda Koy militia, a pro-government paramilitary force – had vowed to avenge relatives they said had been killed or raped by Tuareg rebels belonging to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Few, if any of the women, had seen combat when the photograph was taken.

The story of the Nigerian teachers standing up to Boko Haram militants is nothing more than a hoax.

A wrap of online fakes and hoaxes

There are numerous images circulating online that purport to show Boko Haram atrocities. Some are genuine. Many are not.

Earlier this month, the militant group attacked the towns of Doro Gowon and Baga in northern Nigeria. Eyewitnesses say hundreds were killed and satellite images obtained by human rights groups show that dozens of shops, houses and buildings were torched.

In the weeks since the attack a series of graphic images have spread online as evidence of what has become known as the “Baga massacre”.

Here’s our wrap of the images we have fact-checked so far.

(WARNING: Some of the photographs in the links below are extremely graphic.)

One of the most disturbing photographs shows dozens of charred corpse lying in rows. However the image actually shows the aftermath of a fuel tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010.

Another ghastly image shows the burnt corpses of a mother and child. We have been unable to verify its exact origin, but searches on Google and the reverse image search engine, Tineye.com, show that the image has been circulating since at least 2010 and is therefore not from the recent Baga attacks. Given the condition of the bodies, they may have been victims of the fuel tanker explosion, but we cannot say for certain.

Yet another photograph attributed to the Baga massacre shows a crowd clustered around a mass grave. However, that image dates from a massacre near the Nigerian city of Jos in March 2010.

Then there is the image of a number of grotesquely mutilated corpses strewn across a road next to a bus. It was actually taken in 2010. According to a BBC report at the time, a series of photographs emerged after armed robbers attacked a bus on the Lagos-Benin highway. The victims had reportedly been made to lie down in the road and then the bus driver was ordered to run them over.

Even a Reuters photograph of a group of men lying face down outside a police station after their arrest in the city of Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria on 25 July 2009 has been passed off as evidence of the Baga massacres and has spread widely on the web and Twitter.

Another image that has gone viral on Twitter shows a pile of bloodied bodies lying in street. It is also not from Baga but was taken in July 2009 by an Associated Press photographer outside a police station in the town of Maiduguri after clashes between Nigerian troops and Islamist militants left hundreds dead.

Not all the hoaxes involve images of atrocities. A photograph of two men in camouflage uniform being chased by a zebra has been widely distributed as evidence of the Nigerian army’s cowardice. Trouble is, there are no zebras in the wild in Nigeria. It turns out that the photograph was actually taken by a Reuters photographer in Kenya on 30 July 2007. Two Kenya Wildlife Service rangers, working to help move 2,000 animals to the Meru National Park, had to make a run for it when a recalcitrant zebra charged them.",group twenty woman armed ak assault

275,"An angry aunt is facing jail time in China, after she was interrupted on the toilet by her three-year-old nephew, and proceeded to slice off his penis in anger.

Xue Paan, 37, reportedly attacked her nephew, Qiang Qiang in a rage, while she babysat him as his mother, her sister, went to visit neighbors nearby.

According to reports, Paan was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the bored toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.

The question from the youngster apparently sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife and severed the screaming child’s penis completely.

Having attacked her helpless nephew, Paan reportedly fled the scene as Qiang’s mother heard her son’s screams and rushed to the apartment, “I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.”

The child had apparently fainted from the pain and shock of the ordeal, and was laying a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived, a knife was next to his severed penis.

Qiang’s mother said, “I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.”

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his penis, he and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A spokesperson for the hospital told reporters.

“Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment. However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

Fortunately, the police caught up with the angry aunt, saying, ‘The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.” She now faces up to five years in jail for the attack.",angry aunt facing jail time china interrupted toilet three year old nephew proceeded slice penis anger xue paan reportedly attacked nephew qiang qiang rage babysat mother sister went visit neighbor nearby according report paan sitting toilet sending text message boyfriend bored toddler burst bathroom asked could play game smart phone question youngster apparently sent paan rage went kitchen grabbed blunt knife severed screaming child penis completely attacked helpless nephew paan reportedly fled scene qiang mother heard son scream rushed apartment popped see neighbour gone minute heard qiang qiang scream child apparently fainted pain shock ordeal laying pool blood mother arrived knife next severed penis qiang mother said ran back house believe saw qiang qiang rushed hospital surgeon managed reattach penis sent specialist clinic capital beijing spokesperson hospital told reporter unfortunately knife quite blunt cut clean although reattached boy penis ideal treatment however three surgery successful confident penis perfectly ok three month fortunately police caught angry aunt saying aunt arrested admitted attacking boy angry interrupted toilet face five year jail attack,aunt facing jail time china interrupted toilet three year old nephew proceeded slice penis anger xue paan reportedly attacked nephew qiang qiang rage babysat mother sister went visit neighbor nearby according report paan sitting toilet sending text message boyfriend bored toddler burst bathroom asked could play game smart phone question youngster apparently sent paan rage went kitchen grabbed blunt knife severed screaming child penis completely attacked helpless nephew paan reportedly fled scene qiang mother heard son scream

""I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling,"" she told a Sapa correspondent.

""I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking, but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind.""

The girl, whose name is known to a Sapa correspondent but cannot be published because she is a minor, attacked Humphrey Khoza, 25, with battery acid while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village, near Hazyview, on January 17.

She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them.

""I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl,"" she said.

She searched in her father's tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson.

""While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn't hesitate to pour the acid on him,"" she said.

Khoza, who had no problem with his name being published, but asked not to be photographed, said he had been dating the girl since December.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle, but I didn't realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog,"" he said.

""She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.""

In the video, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, in her school uniform, onto a bed. He added that the sex was consensual.

""We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don't know how it got onto social media,"" he said.

The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.

He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but does not see the point.

""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,"" said Khoza.

He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.

The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography.

According to the Film and Publications Act, child pornography is defined as ""any image or any description of a person, real or simulated, who is, or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, engaged in sexual conduct"".

279,"Charles Manson’s fiancee allegedly had a morbid plan for his body after he died. Given the recent turn of events, his engagement to Afton Elaine Burton, also known as “Star,” is off.

Journalist Daniel Simone spoke with the NY Post about the 27-year-old’s plan to marry one of the most infamous killers in history. Burton reportedly hadn’t planned to marry Manson for love, but for profit. She and a friend by the name of Craig Hammond wanted to rake in money by putting Manson’s corpse in a glass crypt. As Simone says, it was a “California version of Lenin’s Tomb” and “would draw huge crowds and make big money.”

The 80-year-old has no interest in having his body displayed in a glass coffin. He realized what his fiancee was up to and got out. Simone adds that Charles Manson doesn’t believe he’ll ever even face death.

“He feels he will never die. Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

The couple’s marriage license expired on Thursday, as Inquisitr revealed. Burton and Hammond’s website claims they “plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months.”

Simone’s writing partner for The Retrial of Charles Manson is Heidi Joran Ley. The two are looking for someone to publish their book. The authors say Star Burton and her friend allegedly came up with their plan to get Manson’s corpse about two years ago. When the pair asked Manson to sign a document that would allow them to take his body after he dies.

What Burton and Hammond may not have realized, is that Manson was playing them. Simone says Manson didn’t give them a yes or no on signing the document. Since his fiancee and Hammond would bring him “toiletries and other items,” Manson continued “stringing them along” because it “kept the goodies coming.”

Exasperated by their attempt to get Manson to sign over his dead body, a plan was devised to get Burton married to Manson since California law would grant her possession of his remains upon his death, Simone says.

The journalist surmises that Mason had no intention of marrying Star Burton.

In a separate report by Fox 2 News, Burton’s mother disputes the entire report, claiming that her daughter isn’t marrying Charles Manson to get his remains after he dies.

“She is my daughter no matter what is going on in her life. You would love her unconditionally too if she were your child.”

284,"After a number of complaints from passengers about ""random males"" being seated next to their wives, Saudi Arabia's national airline is looking in to segregating their flights.

Saudi Arabia's national airline, Saudia, will order its staff to keep men and women seated separately on flights from now on after passengers complained about the lack of segregation on their flights.

The Emirates247 news website reported that the airline, which already complies with many of the religious practices of Islam including not offering alcohol or dishes that contain pork on their flights, have decided to separate men and women on board, unless they are close relatives.


Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, Saudia's assistant manager for marketing, said that ""there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers"". According to RT.com, Saudia is not the first airline to encounter these issues after Israeli carrier El Al faced delays to a flight back in October as Orthodox Jews refused to be seated next to women on the plane, while Delta have also faced a similar issue, both occurring on flights between Tel Aviv and New York.",number complaint passenger random male seated next wife saudi arabia national airline looking segregating flight saudi arabia national airline saudia order staff keep men woman seated separately flight passenger complained lack segregation flight emirate news website reported airline already complies many religious practice islam including offering alcohol dish contain pork flight decided separate men woman board unless close relative abdul rahman al fahd saudia assistant manager marketing said solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger according rt com saudia first airline encounter issue israeli carrier el al faced delay flight back october orthodox jew refused seated next woman plane delta also faced similar issue occurring flight tel aviv new york,airline already complies many religious practice islam including offering alcohol dish contain pork flight decided separate men woman board unless close relative abdul rahman al fahd saudia assistant manager marketing said solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger according rt com saudia first airline encounter issue israeli carrier el al faced delay flight back october orthodox jew refused seated next woman plane delta also faced similar issue occurring flight tel aviv new york .
287,"BOUCHERVILLE, Que. - Gary Bettman has vehemently denied the NHL is considering expansion.

But the commissioner said if it ever does, prospective owners may have to pay up big time.

Sports Business News reported via Twitter last week the NHL will expand into Las Vegas, Seattle, and Quebec City while adding a second franchise in Toronto by 2017.
On Wednesday, Bettman called the report a ""complete fabrication,"" and took issue with the franchise fees cited in the story — US$1.4 billion, or $350 million per team.

""The part of the story that I found particularly difficult is: suggesting that we would sell four franchises for $1.4 billion is way too low,"" Bettman said. ""It undervalues our franchises.""

The last two expansion teams, the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets, paid $80 million each in expansion fees in 2000, but league revenues have soared since then.

Bettman said the league is not looking to expand or relocate any franchises. He added that no teams were looking to move, including the struggling Florida Panthers — even if their new owner has concerns about the club's arena lease.

""Nobody's moving,"" said Bettman. ""And speculation to the contrary not only is wrong, it's unfair to the team and their fans who are being speculated about.

""Our franchises have never been healthier. Our league, in terms of its economic footing, has never been healthier.""

He made the remarks at an event put on by a media company, Quebecor, that hopes to bring NHL hockey back to Quebec City.

NHL coffers were fattened by a 12-year deal worth $5.2 billion with Rogers, which will begin broadcasting games this season on Sportsnet. Quebecor reportedly will pay Rogers a total of $1.5 billion over 12 years for the French-language portion of the broadcast rights, with games aired mainly on TVA Sports.

Quebecor bought naming rights on a $400 million arena due to be completed by fall 2015 in Quebec City, which hopes to land an NHL club.

Bettman attended TVA Sports' hockey launch at a suburban restaurant along with former prime minister Brian Mulroney, who is chairman of Quebecor, Montreal Canadiens owner Geoff Molson, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League president Gilles Courteau and other league and company officials.

However, Bettman had no encouraging words for those looking to revive the Quebec Nordiques, who left in 1994 to become the Colorado Avalanche.

""We don't want to build up anybody's expectations,"" he said. ""We're not in a position to expand.

""We're certainly not in position to expand into the East. We've been very candid and up front that if in fact we go through an expansion process, the world will know about it. But we're not looking to relocate any franchises, and we're not looking to expand. We've been very clear about that since Day One when we were told about the building of the new arena.""

Still, rumours that the league is at least considering adding teams have been circulating. A report from Vancouver last week said a team in Las Vegas was a ""done deal.""

Bettman said there's plenty of interest from people wanting NHL expansion teams but added the league hasn't even begun to research the issue.

In June, Bettman said that if there were enough expansion candidates the league's board of governors ""may well invoke a formal expansion process and we will look at everything.""

Mulroney had no comment on Quebec City's expansion prospects.

During the news conference, the former Conservative prime minister joked that he was a ""right winger"" when he played as a boy in Baie-Comeau, Que., and told a story about how his father discouraged him from trying to become a pro player because there was no money in hockey.

""If he was alive today, I'd take him by the hand and say: 'Let me introduce you to P.K. Subban,'"" he said.

The Montreal Canadiens defenceman signed a $72 million, eight-year contract on Aug. 2.

Bettman said the league is close to naming a successor to Brendan Shanahan as disciplinarian and head of player safety. Shanahan stepped down in April and was replaced on an interim basis by Stephane Quintal.

""We're getting to the short strokes of that process,"" said Bettman. ""We've interviewed a lot of candidates, including somebody who's been doing it on an interim basis, and we will be making a decision shortly.

""We wanted to finish the process. By the start of the season, we'll have an announcement.""",boucherville que gary bettman vehemently denied nhl considering expansion commissioner said ever prospective owner may pay big time sport business news reported via twitter last week nhl expand la vega seattle quebec city adding second franchise toronto wednesday bettman called report complete fabrication took issue franchise fee cited story u billion million per team part story found particularly difficult suggesting would sell four franchise billion way low bettman said undervalues franchise last two expansion team minnesota wild columbus blue jacket paid million expansion fee league revenue soared since bettman said league looking expand relocate franchise added team looking move including struggling florida panther even new owner concern club arena lease nobody moving said bettman speculation contrary wrong unfair team fan speculated franchise never healthier league term economic footing never healthier made remark event put medium company quebecor hope bring nhl hockey back quebec city nhl coffer fattened year deal worth billion rogers begin broadcasting game season sportsnet quebecor reportedly pay rogers total billion year french language portion broadcast right game aired mainly tva sport quebecor bought naming right million arena due completed fall quebec city hope land nhl club bettman attended tva sport hockey launch suburban restaurant along former prime minister brian mulroney chairman quebecor montreal canadiens owner geoff molson quebec major junior hockey league president gilles courteau league company official however bettman encouraging word looking revive quebec nordiques left become colorado avalanche want build anybody expectation said position expand certainly position expand east candid front fact go expansion process world know looking relocate franchise looking expand clear since day one told building new arena still rumour league least considering adding team circulating report vancouver last week said team la vega done deal bettman said plenty interest people wanting nhl expansion team added league even begun research issue june bettman said enough expansion candidate league board governor may well invoke formal expansion process look everything mulroney comment quebec city expansion prospect news conference former conservative prime minister joked right winger played boy baie comeau que told story father discouraged trying become pro player money hockey alive today take hand say let introduce p k subban said montreal canadiens defenceman signed million eight year contract aug bettman said league close naming successor brendan shanahan disciplinarian head player safety shanahan stepped april replaced interim basis stephane quintal getting short stroke process said bettman interviewed lot candidate including somebody interim basis making decision shortly wanted finish process start season announcement,nhl expansion commissioner said ever prospective owner may pay big time sport business news reported via twitter last week nhl expand lavega seattle quebec city adding second franchise toronto wednesday bettman called report complete fabrication took issue franchise fee cited story u billion million per team part story found particularly difficult suggesting would sell four franchise billion way low bettman said undervalues franchise last two expansion team minnesota wild columbus blue jacket paid million expansion fee league revenue soared
290,"Are you a fan of Justin Bieber’s music? If not, you may want to convert yourself into a “Belieber” because it may save your life one day.

According to the New York Post , a fisherman in Russia was attacked by a brown bear, but was able to escape death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and scared the bear.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was heading toward his favorite fishing spot in Russia’s Yakutia Republic when a bear started clawing at him, according to The Austrian Times .

The man told the news agency that his granddaughter had downloaded the hit song “Baby” onto his phone as a joke. As funny as the joke may be, it was lifesaving when his phone rang during the attack and Bieber’s melody scared the bear.

According to the report, the man said the bear halted the attack and fled back into the forest.

The man said he “couldn’t believe” his luck.

According to wildlife experts who spoke with The Austrian Times, a “sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks” as the ringtone was a “very unexpected sound for a bear”.

In a photo of the man, bruises and injuries can be seen on his hands, head and chest.

A jilted wife has been arrested amid reports she chopped off her cheating husband's penis twice.

According to reports in China, two-timing dad-of-five Fan Lung, 32, used his wife's phone to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in Shangqiu.

But he forgot to log out of his account and his stunned wife, Feng, 30, came across the message along with several others, which sent her flying into a rage.

Furious, she's said to have grabbed a pair of scissors and stormed into their bedroom, where he was sleeping, and snipped off his manhood.

Fan was rushed to hospital, where the organ was sewn back on.

However, Feng is then reported to have sneaked back into her husband's hospital room and cut off his penis for a second time, this time throwing it out of a window.

A hospital spokesman said: ""The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital.

""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

""He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.""

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man’s missing member. They believed it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman added: ""The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

""He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.""

Fan’s lover who arrived at the hospital said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

Everything was going well until the day of the wedding. Just when the groom, 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, lifted his arms to put the ""varmala"" (garland for the wedding) around 23-year-old Indira's neck, he had an epileptic fit and fell to the ground, according to The Times of India.
Agitated at the groom's family for hiding the truth, Indira called off her wedding with Kishore and announced she will marry Harpal Singh, who was present at the wedding.
Singh, the brother-in-law of Indira's sister, was shocked on hearing this. But, he agreed to marry Indira and their wedding took place in peace. A while later, Kishore, who was taken to a doctor, came back and requested Indira to marry him.
The tension intensified when the groom's relatives took to violence and began throwing spoons, plates and dishes around. They even filed an FIR at the Milak Police Station against the bride's family, but later withdrew it on elders' suggestion.

Once on the plane, he was greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a Merry Christmas.

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas,’ ” the man retorted.

The man refused to calm down, insisting that the greeting was inappropriate.

After the endoscopy, Joan's personal doctor (an ear, nose and throat specialist uncertified by the clinic) allegedly performed an unauthorized biopsy without Joan's consent, according to the staff member.
During this alleged biopsy is when Joan reportedly experienced cardiac arrest, according to the source.

306,"An Egyptian man named Abu Obeida al-Masri has reportedly fled to Turkey with more than $1 million belonging to ISIS.

Obeida was secretary of the Zakat bureau and treasurer of the ISIS Syrian branch before fleeing with the money, notes the IBTimes UK. The amount he stole reportedly reached one billion Syrian pounds.

According to the Hidaya Foundation, Zakat is an obligatory act that has to be performed by every adult and able-bodied Muslim. It is an important pillar among the five pillars of Islam. Zakat is a part of the wealth and property that Muslims must pay annually, to help the poor of their community. One of the main purposes of Zakat is to keep those who are wealthy clean, monetarily, from sin. It is a form of Sadaqah (charity) which is obligatory for Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ISIS ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

When the merchants told ISIS militants that they are already helping and supporting the poor families with money and aid, ISIS did not exempt them from paying the 2.5%.

""The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,"" they explained.

As a result of this incident, rumors claim that ISIS militants have issued an order to no longer recruit any Egyptian jihadists.

This financial blow to ISIS is not the only breaking news from the terrorist group as a recent video was released on Tuesday which showed Jordanian pilot al-Kaseasbeh being burned alive. This has sparked European and United States outrage against the terrorist group.

Jordanian officials have sworn vengeance against the Islamic State terrorist group for murdering al-Kaseasbeh. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has also issued a statement condemning the brutality and violence that ISIS has repeatedly shown against humanity.

“ISIL is trying to build this overarching caliphate through which there is no diversity of thought, of religion, values or culture,” says Gianni Pittella, member of the European Parliament. “The fact remains that ISIL is a very pernicious entity.”

310,"**Update added (see below)**

In a report that aired on Fox News Channel’s “The Kelly File,” host Megyn Kelly revealed U.S. Marines stationed to guard the U.S. Embassy in Yemen were instructed by the State Department to surrender their weapons to local authorities upon the evacuation of those facilities.

“[L]ate last night, the State Department ordering all personnel in the U.S. embassy in Yemen to pack up and get out,” Kelly explained. “Last month an Iranian-backed rebel group overthrowing the U.S.-backed government — it’s a group which you can see here, is not particularly fond of the United States, as they chant “death to America.” And now they are consolidating power and the security situation for Americans is rapidly deteriorating. Now tonight a senior defense official confirming to Fox News that Marines were directed to turn over their weapons before they were allowed to leave. According to one source the order came from the U.S. State Department. That is generating some serious outrage tonight especially among Marines who are taught from day one never surrender your weapon. At least one Marine telling Fox News, ‘Blank yeah, it pissed me off.’ Pardon me, his term. ‘I’m not giving up my weapon to anyone.’”

UPDATE:

The U.S. Marine Corp denied the report in a statement released Wednesday night:

The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the “ordered departure” with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were ‘handed over’ in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.

Upon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning.

314,"(Reuters) - The Islamic State militant group released a video purporting to show the beheading of U.S. hostage Steven Sotloff, the SITE monitoring service reported on Tuesday.

A masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage, a man the group named as David Haines, and warned governments to back off ""this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State"", the monitoring service said.

315,"A “tempting eyes” ban has just been announced in Saudi Arabia that further represses women more than they already are. In this part of the world, women are known to cover their bodies completely from head-to-toe. The eyes are one of the only parts of their body that are seen in public.

Opposing Views reports that women who have eyes “with a nice shape and makeup” could be deemed too tempting to other men, and police can make them wear veils. Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced this decision a few days ago. It’s one bound to get universal criticism.

Assyrian International News Agency covered what the Saudi Arabian committee’s spokesman has to say about the new law. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, explains that Saudi police “have a right” to make a woman cover her eyes.

“The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.”

This development has sparked the question of what defines “tempting eyes” and how will women be evaluated on having them? An unidentified journalist in the nation best describes what Saudi police are going after.

“Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.”

He adds that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia will be very upset about the law. This type of control will outrage citizens of the country, the unnamed journalist says.

“It’s so stupid. I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

The report notes that no divide between Church and State exists in Saudi Arabia. The bad part is that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has powerful “backers” that include Prince Naif, the heir to the nation’s throne. He announced that the committee “should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.”

If there was any hope among the people that King Abdullah’s son would steer Saudi Arabia in a different direction, it’s lost at this point. By supporting the committee, the prince also supports the “tempting eye ban.” Oppression will continue in the nation, as women are considered nothing more than property.

316,"Microsoft is nearing a deal to buy Mojang AB, makers of the Minecraft video game franchise, according to a new report. According to the Wall Street Journal, the deal would value Mojang at more than $2 billion and could be signed as soon as this week.

Microsoft and Mojang declined to comment to the Journal. As the Journal notes, the move would be surprising given that Mojang founder Markkus ""Notch"" Persson, is a darling of the indie gaming scene who has avoided taking venture capital. He has also criticized Microsoft's Windows 8 for potentially being ""very, very bad for indie games.""

AN UNLIKELY TARGET FOR ACQUISITION

Minecraft, which first came out in 2009, has sold more than 50 million copies. Stockholm-based Mojang had $100 million in profits last year, according to the Journal. It's a reflection of the fact that Minecraft, an open-world game where players can build almost anything they can imagine while avoiding spiders and other dangers, has become a multi-platform global phenomenon. The Journal argues that owning Minecraft could ""invigorate"" Microsoft's Xbox business, though the game has long been available on that platform.

Mojang has been seen as an unlikely target for acquisition because its small team of about 40 people makes a highly profitable game in Minecraft and whose leader has expressed a desire to invest those profits in unusual new games. Persson has also been critical of large corporations in general; he canceled a planned version of Minecraft for Oculus Rift after the virtual reality company sold to Facebook.",microsoft nearing deal buy mojang ab maker minecraft video game franchise according new report according wall street journal deal would value mojang billion could signed soon week microsoft mojang declined comment journal journal note move would surprising given mojang founder markkus notch persson darling indie gaming scene avoided taking venture capital also criticized microsoft window potentially bad indie game unlikely target acquisition minecraft first came sold million copy stockholm based mojang million profit last year according journal reflection fact minecraft open world game player build almost anything imagine avoiding spider danger become multi platform global phenomenon journal argues owning minecraft could invigorate microsoft xbox business though game long available platform mojang seen unlikely target acquisition small team people make highly profitable game minecraft whose leader expressed desire invest profit unusual new game persson also critical large corporation general canceled planned version minecraft oculus rift virtual reality company sold facebook,microsoft nearing deal buy mojang ab maker minecraft video game franchise according new report according wall street journal deal would value mojang billion could signed soon week microsoft mojang declined comment journal note move would surprising given mojang founder markkus notch persson darling indie gaming scene avoided taking venture capital also criticized microsoft window potentially bad indie game unlikely target acquisition minecraft first came sold million copy stockholm based mojang million profit last year according journal reflection fact minecraft open world game player
317,"Joan Rivers' cardiac arrest may have been triggered by an unauthorized biopsy that the comedian's personal physician — who apparently took a selfie in the operating room — performed on Rivers' vocal cords, CNN reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources close to the investigation.

The 81-year-old Rivers was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan for a scheduled endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen to diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat. A source told CNN that after Cohen completed the procedure, which involves putting a camera down the throat, Rivers' personal physician — an unidentified ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic — stepped in to perform the vocal-cord biopsy, corroborating an earlier report by the Daily News.

CNN also reported that an unnamed clinic staff member told investigators that the personal physician took a selfie in the room while Rivers was under. CNN's source also said neither the gastroenterologist nor the ear, nose and throat doctor had been accused of wrongdoing.

A procedure such as a vocal cord biopsy requires patient consent and would only be authorized to take place in a hospital setting. The clinic released a statement last week saying no such biopsy was performed on Rivers, and declined to respond to CNN's report, citing federal privacy laws.

However CNN's source said investigators are focusing on the biopsy and believe her vocal chords started swelling after the physician made a spur-of-the-moment decision to remove a growth with a scalpel. The swelling may have cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which could have triggered cardiac arrest, according to CNN and the Daily News.

Rivers suffered cardiac arrest on Aug. 29, and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

318,"Apple originally planned for the Apple Watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features, but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this April, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Apple Watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin. You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive.

The Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse). But Apple couldn't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted. It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors. And the watch didn't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist.

Other features that didn't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking, according to The Journal. Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the US. We do know, however, that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency's regulation.

Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply couldn't get them to work. That doesn't mean that it isn't going to add them back in future versions of the device, though.

Elsewhere in its article, The Journal says the Apple Watch was known at Apple by the name ""black hole"" because it kept drawing in more and more resources.

319,"Rabat – Following some men’s complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives, Saudi Arabian national airline Saudia is moving forward to segregate men and women on its airplanes.

According to news360, Saudia will order staff to keep men and women segregated on board their planes, unless they are close relatives.

Multiple reports suggest that the policy change came in response to complaints from men unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members.

Saudi daily Ajel quoted Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd as saying that “there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

This policy comes as part of Saudi Arabia’s culture of gender segregation, which is deeply rooted in the mentality of minimizing the exposure of women in society.

In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to travel or work until they get their male guardian’s (mahram) approval.

325,"Yes, that's right. Last week, Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ""adopted"" a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf, according to multiple news reports. She tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil, the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family, during which the Tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it. The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.

In the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.

Tales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was ""Luison,"" who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and eats corpses.

Some historians dispute the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and suggest the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants.

Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state. After all, the U.S. president participates in the ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year.",yes right last week argentine president cristina fern ndez de kirchner adopted boy godson prevent turning werewolf according multiple news report tweeted image small ceremony conducted family yair tawil seventh child argentine jewish family tawils met president lit candle menorah ten raz n trajeron de regalo un candelabro de israel pidieron que encendiera la vela pic twitter com dvwewmzera cristina kirchner cfkargentina december tradition hold seventh son family doomed turn werewolf known el lobison argentina th birthday stalk night beastly form feeding dead murdering legend stem indigenous folklore melded superstition european settler th century fear werewolf child pronounced many seventh son killed born started practice argentine leader taking child symbolically wing past half century ceremony opened girl first time jew tawil family appealed argentine government early practice extended non catholic family boy new status president godson win gold medal well full educational scholarship according independent tale shape shifting demon feral monster slaughtering livestock found many part latin america argentine iteration traced local guarani story seven cursed spawn tau evil mythological spirit kerana beautiful woman seduced kidnapped seventh son luison appears sometimes shape small dog eats corps historian dispute connection belief folk horror presidential act adopting seventh son godson suggest latter distinct custom brought eastern european migrant american quick scoff tradition embrace argentina head state u president participates ritual pardoning fluffy presumably bewildered animal every year,argentina december tradition hold seventh son family doomed turn werewolf known el lobison argentina th birthday stalk night beastly form feeding dead murdering legend stem indigenous folklore melded superstition european settler th century fear werewolf child pronounced many seventh son killed born started practice argentine leader taking child symbolically wing past half century ceremony opened girl first time jew tawil family appealed argentine government early practice extended non
326,"(Reuters) - Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State (IS) had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded IS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons.

327,"Mittens is a perfectly normal cat who, according to the CBC, “enjoys being scratched under the chin and chasing string around,” except the little fur ball has both male and female genitalia.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy of Heart’s Desire, Newfoundland in Canada said her daughter brought the cat home thinking it was a sick stray. When the took it to the vet, they discovered it was a hermaphrodite.

Though Clarke-Murphy says she would like another female cat, the vet recommends that Mittens be assigned as a male and she’s following that advice.

“I think it’s got both personalities,” she told CBC, “so it really don’t matter.”

The procedure would have Mittens both spayed and neutered and reconstructive surgery would be performed. The surgery would help Mittens with urinary and bowel problems arising from its dual gender.

Clarke-Murphy’s friends are raising funds by selling used items on Facebook.

The bill? A cool $1,500.

328,"Last week, President Cristina Kirchner adopted a Jewish teenager named Yair Tawil and posted pictures of the event on her Twitter feed. Outlets around the world ran with the story, explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore, only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite, but in Argentina, the story's a little different: the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore, seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus, the need for presidential action is pretty clear.

""The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions,"" Oscar Chamosa, a folklorist at the University of Georgia, told me. ""The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco—or the were-jaguar—which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf."" Chamosa says he's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys.

But even if someone who's devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can't explain it, the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century, and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children, that the myth became a public policy problem. After all, terrified parents were (according to legend, at least) regularly committing infanticide.

""In order to counteract the myth, Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family,"" Chamosa explains, adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. ""The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it.""

This idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies, so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago, it's downright bizarre that they're still entertaining the notion of it today.

As per a decree that came out in 1973, adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children, because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non-Catholics. As the Independent noted, Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock, it's also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America.

The boy's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993, but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchner's account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils, quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent.

Jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event, and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted—even symbolically—by a non-Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. (In Jewish folklore, people don't turn into werewolves, and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed.)

But most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like, for instance, that's it's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies.

Stories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves, which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own country's recent memory believed they were chosen by God, Chamosa describes Argentina's Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who's a ""progressive left-wing president—more like a Marxist and a secular person in general."" Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year, this is an Argentine ritual that's basically a national inside joke.

Chamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason, anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same-sex children is rewarded with the prize.

Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon.

""Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory, especially—but not only—in rural areas,"" Chamosa says. ""I would say that only old people still believe [in el lobison]. But you really don't know.""

The company laid off tens of thousands of people in recent years as sales crumbled, with customers shifting to mobile devices like smartphones and computer tablets. That has drastically curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.

The company said Monday that the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)

HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the Enterprise business. HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc.

""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" Whitman said. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics.""

The split, if approved by the company board, is expected to close by the end of fiscal 2015. Once complete, HP stockholders will own shares of both companies.

During its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of $27.6 billion, a 1 percent annual gain. It marked HP's first year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from technology services like consulting, software and financial programs.

HP is expected to complete the latest round of layoffs, between 11,000 to 16,000 people, this month. That is on top of the 34,000 people it had already jettisoned from its payroll.

Another tech stalwart announced a split this month. In a bid to drive growth, eBay Inc. said it would spin off its mobile payment service PayPal into a separate and publicly traded company. Investors sent eBay shares up more than 7 percent on the day of the announcement.

HP maintained its guidance for fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings between $3.70 and $3.74 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.73 per share.

For fiscal 2015, the company anticipates adjusted earnings in a range of $3.83 to $4.03 per share. Wall Street is looking for $3.96 per share.

Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, California, gained $2.85, or 8.1 percent, to $38.05 before the market open.

336,"The family of beheaded American photojournalist James Foley are facing fresh agony after sick Islamic State militants tried to sell them his headless body for $1million, according to a new report by Buzzfeed.

The website spoke to three middlemen trying to broker the deal, who say they can prove the body is Foley's with a DNA swab and will deliver the remains across the Turkish border once the ransom has been paid.

Foley was the first American hostage to be beheaded by an ISIS militant in a graphic video recording this summer. Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism.

Remains: ISIS militants are allegedly trying to sell the body of beheaded American hostage James Foley for $1million. The photojournalist was executed by the terrorist group this past summer, in a highly-graphic video recording (still from the video above)

Victim: Foley was kidnapped from a cafe in a northwestern Syrian town on November 22, 2012. He was working as a photojournalist covering the civil war at the time

The three middlemen interviewed by Buzzfeed include a Syrian rebel fighter, a businessman and an official for the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel group helping to fight ISIS in the civil war-torn country.

The rebel fighter, who also claimed to have connections to Jubhat al-Nusra (Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate), called his work 'a humanity case' since he believes returning the body to Foley's parents will help bring them closure.

'They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,' he said. 'They will not give the DNA without the money.'

But the FSA official warned Buzzfeed against publishing the article, believing the U.S. government would shut the deal down if they found out.

Foley was one of 23 Western hostages held by ISIS earlier this year. Fifteen of the hostages were freed when their respective European governments paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages were left behind since neither country negotiates with terrorists.

Next offer: Before Foley was executed, ISIS allegedly offered to release him if his family paid a $132million ransom, but the amount was not paid since the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. Foley's parents John and Diane speak after the video depicting his beheading was released in August

It was previously reported that before Foley's death, his family was approached by the group with a $132million ransom to secure their son's release, but that U.S. officials made it clear that if they paid the ransom themselves it would be an act of treason.

'It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,' the FSA official said, of selling the body. 'People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.'

The Foley family have not yet commented on the story, and the U.S. State Department told Buzzfeed 'we are seeking more information'.

Holding Western captives for ransom is one of the main ways terrorists groups like ISIS raise money. A New York Times report published this year found that Al Qaeda has made at least $125million from ransoms since 2008, with $66million raised in 2013 alone.",family beheaded american photojournalist james foley facing fresh agony sick islamic state militant tried sell headless body million according new report buzzfeed website spoke three middleman trying broker deal say prove body foley dna swab deliver remains across turkish border ransom paid foley first american hostage beheaded isi militant graphic video recording summer since august terrorist group overtaking large swathe syria iraq beheaded two american briton similar display barbarism remains isi militant allegedly trying sell body beheaded american hostage james foley million photojournalist executed terrorist group past summer highly graphic video recording still video victim foley kidnapped cafe northwestern syrian town november working photojournalist covering civil war time three middleman interviewed buzzfeed include syrian rebel fighter businessman official free syrian army fsa u backed rebel group helping fight isi civil war torn country rebel fighter also claimed connection jubhat al nusra al qaeda syrian affiliate called work humanity case since belief returning body foley parent help bring closure ask million send dna turkey want money first said give dna without money fsa official warned buzzfeed publishing article believing u government would shut deal found foley one western hostage held isi earlier year fifteen hostage freed respective european government paid million dollar ransom british american hostage left behind since neither country negotiates terrorist next offer foley executed isi allegedly offered release family paid million ransom amount paid since u negotiate terrorist foley parent john diane speak video depicting beheading released august previously reported foley death family approached group million ransom secure son release u official made clear paid ransom would act treason like shame u government fsa official said selling body people ask brought body bring alive foley family yet commented story u state department told buzzfeed seeking information holding western captive ransom one main way terrorist group like isi raise money new york time report published year found al qaeda made least million ransom since million raised alone,isi militant allegedly trying sell body beheaded american photojournalist james foley facing fresh agony sick islamic state militant tried sell headless body million according new report buzzfeed website spoke three middleman trying broker deal say prove body foley dna swab deliver remains across turkish border ransom paid foley first american hostage beheaded isi militant graphic video recording summer since august terrorist group overtaking large swathe syria iraq

340,"Apple and Path are close to a reaching a buyout agreement, according to a new report from PandoDaily. The social network app would likely be built into Apple Messages to some degree, although details remain unknown.
According to a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin’s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, “It’s almost done, if not signed already, but it’s essentially a done deal.”
Path has a lot of ties to Apple in terms of talent leading all the way up the food chain to CEO Dave Morin, who is a former Apple employee. Morin was spotted sitting up front during the iPhone 6/Apple Watch keynote on Tuesday, a place usually reserved for top Apple executives.
After being on the App Store for several years, Path has struggled to gain traction. While the company claims that its user base has been growing steadily in recent months, its still dwarfed by social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
Path started as a network for only your 150 closest friends, but the app has since loosened those restrictions and let you add more people. Its most recent app, Talk, is a private messenger with a few bells and whistles. “Ambient Status” lets the user know when friends are in his or her area, and additional media like music, movies, books, and maps can be shared with friends. Path is also working on a feature called Place Messaging that will let users communicate directly with local businesses to make dinner reservations, book appointments, and more.
In iOS 8, Apple’s Messages app can send quick audio messages, and recent contacts are displayed above the app switcher. It’s easy to imagine Apple making its messaging experience more social, although it’s unclear how Path specifically would help.

341,"THE ISLAMIC State is bankrolling its terror operations by harvesting organs, the UN Security Council has been told.

Dozens of bodies have been discovered with surgical incisions as well as missing kidneys and other vital organs, Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations Mohamed Alhakim briefed a security council.

The corpses were found piled up in shallow, mass graves over the last few weeks.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim yesterday urged the UN Security Council to investigate the allegations of organ harvesting.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said.

""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

Ambassador Alhakim claimed a dozen doctors were ""executed"" by the Islamic State in Mosul, in northern Iraq, for refusing to harvest organs for the terror group.

Mosul, which was seized by Islamic State militants in June last year, is the third largest city in Iraq and home to more than a million people.

The Iraqi ambassador also accused the Islamic State – also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL – of ""crimes of genocide"" by targeting certain ethnic groups.

Nikolay Mladenov, the outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, reported that 790 people were killed in the country by terrorism and armed conflict in January alone.

Mr Mladenov confirmed there have been an increasing number of reports of ISIS using organ harvesting to finance part of their operations.

But he said that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.""

The black market for human organs is growing rapidly, revealed a major investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2012.

Some 10,000 black market operations involving human organs take place each year across the globe – more than one an hour.

Desperate patients will pay gangs more than $200,000 (nearly £128,000) for a kidney, WHO concluded.

""There is a growing need for transplants and big profits to be made. It's ever growing, it's a constant struggle,"" Luc Noel, a doctor and WHO official, told The Guardian.

""The stakes are so big, the profit that can be made so huge.""

Islamic State currently hold a third of Iraq and neighbouring Syria – imposing strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mr Mladenov added.

Earlier this week, Iraqi prime minister Haider Abadi confirmed plans are underway to liberate the city of Mosul.

""I'm pretty sure that we can liberate Mosul with the minimum of casualties and costs,"" Mr Abadi said.

The news of Iraq's show of force against Islamic State in Mosul came hours after Egyptian media reported killing '64 jihadists' in a series of aerial assaults launched as a retaliation for the beheading of 21 Egyptians at the hands of ISIS extremists.

Egyptian warplanes bombed Islamic State targets in Libya including weapon storage sites and training camps.

Pope Francis denounced the merciless beheading – branding it a ""barbaric assassination"".

351,"London (AFP) - The British government on Saturday said it had received reports that ""Jihadi John"", the British-accented Islamic State militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages, had been injured in a US air strike.

The Foreign Office could not confirm reports published in the Mail on Sunday that the masked executioner, who has appeared in a series of grisly videos posted online, had been wounded while attending a meeting of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last week.

According to the paper, he was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, on Saturday that killed around 10 IS commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning.

Despite being a foreigner, the masked assassin, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group that swept across Syria and northern Iraq.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the IS's Syrian stronghold of Raqa, according to the Mail's source.

353,"A group of twenty women armed with AK-47 assault rifles stare defiantly at a camera. Most appear to be civilians, although three of them are wearing military-style camouflage uniforms. One woman stands in front of the rest, her rifle aimed forward at waist level. The muzzle appears to have been taped over, possibly to keep dust out of the barrel.

On Twitter, Facebook and the Web, the women have been hailed as heroes in the fight against Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. “Nigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts,” read a typical tweet of the image this week.

The photograph has been circulating for some time. We found posts dating to 2013, but the image appears to have gone viral in April 2014, around the time that more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in Chibok. It has gained renewed currency since this month’s Baga massacre and the battle for the city of Maiduguri.

Boko Haram attack repelled by ‘armed women’

Many of the more recent tweets link to a fringe news website, Countercurrentnews.com, and a post dated 27 May 2014. The photo is prominently displayed. “Another Boko Haram attack repelled by armed women,” reads the headline.

“Several Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists,” the article continues.

“The notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.”

‘Get ‘em ladies’

Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 9.40.33 AMA pro-gun Facebook page in the United States that calls itself “Hypocrisy and Stupidity of Gun Control Advocates” has also appropriated the photo, suggesting that it shows a group of Nigerian teachers.

It posted the image on 20 January 2015, along with this caption: “When Boko Haram showed up to kill and rape us and our students we didn’t hide or throw spaghetti-os…We shot them in the face because we don’t ‘demand’ action – we take action.”

The picture was shared more than 400 times and by 30 January 2015, just over 1,200 Facebook users had “liked” it. “You get ’em ladies,” wrote one. “I find their lack of belt fed weapons and RPGs troubling,” said another. “Face shooting is definitely the way to go,” added a third.

Solving a mystery

We were intrigued. Where was the photograph taken? What had happened? Who were the women? Were they teachers? Villagers? Vigilantes? We decided to do a little cyber-sleuthing.

The first clue was a green, yellow and red football shirt worn by a woman in the back row. The second was a bright blue dress worn by another woman with white patches bearing a symbol in similar shades of green, yellow and red. Could they be colours of a national flag?

The Nigerian flag is green and white. The flag of neighbouring Benin is green, yellow and red but not all the bands run parallel. The colours also appear in Mali’s flag. Usually they run vertically, not horizontally, as they do in the football shirt. But a Google search for images of “Mali football jersey” produced photos of football shirts strikingly similar to that worn by the woman in the back row.

Verifying images

Two invaluable tools that we regularly use at Africa Check to establish the veracity of photos circulating online are Google’s image search function and the “reverse image search” engine, Tineye-com. (For more tips, check out our guide to spotting online fakes and hoaxes.)

We uploaded the image to Google. The results weren’t encouraging. There were dozens of links to web pages, Facebook posts and tweets all claiming that the photograph showed armed Nigerian women who had fought off Boko Haram. None offered any details of where the picture had been taken and who had taken it.

In fact, the image had been so widely published in relation to Boko Haram that Google’s suggested search term after we uploaded it was “boko haram women”.

We changed the search term to “Mali” and hit enter.

The claim is a hoax

As it turns out, our hunch was correct. The photo was first published on 23 November, 2012 in The Times of London. It had been taken by a Times photographer, Jack Hill, in the town of Sevare in Mali and accompanied an article by one of the newspaper’s correspondents, Jerome Starkey, about “women bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali”.

The women – all members of the Ganda Koy militia, a pro-government paramilitary force – had vowed to avenge relatives they said had been killed or raped by Tuareg rebels belonging to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Few, if any of the women, had seen combat when the photograph was taken.

The story of the Nigerian teachers standing up to Boko Haram militants is nothing more than a hoax.

A wrap of online fakes and hoaxes

There are numerous images circulating online that purport to show Boko Haram atrocities. Some are genuine. Many are not.

Earlier this month, the militant group attacked the towns of Doro Gowon and Baga in northern Nigeria. Eyewitnesses say hundreds were killed and satellite images obtained by human rights groups show that dozens of shops, houses and buildings were torched.

In the weeks since the attack a series of graphic images have spread online as evidence of what has become known as the “Baga massacre”.

Here’s our wrap of the images we have fact-checked so far.

(WARNING: Some of the photographs in the links below are extremely graphic.)

One of the most disturbing photographs shows dozens of charred corpse lying in rows. However the image actually shows the aftermath of a fuel tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010.

Another ghastly image shows the burnt corpses of a mother and child. We have been unable to verify its exact origin, but searches on Google and the reverse image search engine, Tineye.com, show that the image has been circulating since at least 2010 and is therefore not from the recent Baga attacks. Given the condition of the bodies, they may have been victims of the fuel tanker explosion, but we cannot say for certain.

Yet another photograph attributed to the Baga massacre shows a crowd clustered around a mass grave. However, that image dates from a massacre near the Nigerian city of Jos in March 2010.

Then there is the image of a number of grotesquely mutilated corpses strewn across a road next to a bus. It was actually taken in 2010. According to a BBC report at the time, a series of photographs emerged after armed robbers attacked a bus on the Lagos-Benin highway. The victims had reportedly been made to lie down in the road and then the bus driver was ordered to run them over.

Even a Reuters photograph of a group of men lying face down outside a police station after their arrest in the city of Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria on 25 July 2009 has been passed off as evidence of the Baga massacres and has spread widely on the web and Twitter.

Another image that has gone viral on Twitter shows a pile of bloodied bodies lying in street. It is also not from Baga but was taken in July 2009 by an Associated Press photographer outside a police station in the town of Maiduguri after clashes between Nigerian troops and Islamist militants left hundreds dead.

Not all the hoaxes involve images of atrocities. A photograph of two men in camouflage uniform being chased by a zebra has been widely distributed as evidence of the Nigerian army’s cowardice. Trouble is, there are no zebras in the wild in Nigeria. It turns out that the photograph was actually taken by a Reuters photographer in Kenya on 30 July 2007. Two Kenya Wildlife Service rangers, working to help move 2,000 animals to the Meru National Park, had to make a run for it when a recalcitrant zebra charged them.

354,"Thieves stole a man's penis while he slept, according to police.

Fei Lin, 41, of the Niqiao village near Wenling City, in east China’s Zhejiang province, told police he was asleep when the thieves burst into his room and put a bag over his head, according to CEN/EUROPICS and as reported in the Daily Star.

""They put something over my head and pulled down my trousers and then they ran off,"" Lin said. ""I was so shocked I didn't feel a thing - then I saw I was bleeding and my penis was gone.""

Police believe the attackers were jealous lovers of several local women whom Lin was having affairs with, the Austrian Times reported. Lin denied taking part in any infidelity.

Emergency workers and police searched for Lin's anatomy but turned up nothing, according to TNT Magazine. The penis thieves are nowhere to be found, but police said they're looking for the jealous lovers.

356,"Technology giant Hewlett-Packard will break in two, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

The company will reportedly be divided between its PC and printers units and its corporate hardware and services operations. Hewlett-Packard will announce the separation as early as Monday, according to WSJ.

The split is the latest in a series of high-profile technology breakups, following close on the heels of eBay's decision to spin off PayPal last week. Many expect better performance when a large company becomes focused on a more limited number of business lines.

Meg Whitman will be CEO of the corporate hardware and services company and act as chairman of the PC and printer company, according to the WSJ's sources. Dion Weisler will be CEO of the PC side, and Patricia Russo will be chairman of the corporate side.

HP has considered splitting up for years.

358,"A wicked aunt cut her three-year-old nephew’s penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her phone.

Xue Paan, 37, was sending text messages to her boyfriend while sitting on the toilet when toddler Qiang Qiang walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile.

But instead of giving him the phone, the fuming aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and severed the boy’s penis while his mother was visiting a next-door neighbour in Luohe, a city in central China’s Henan Province.

Horrified mum Cai Tuan, 27, said: “I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

“I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.

“Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

“Next to him was a knife and his penis.

“It was simply horrific.

“My sister, his aunt, had gone.”

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the penis and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said: “Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

“However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

A police spokesman said: “The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

361,"HONG KONG—Thousands of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have, perhaps unwittingly, united themselves with another protest movement some 8,000 miles away. Activists demanding free elections for the semi-autonomous territory have been holding their hands up in the air in a symbol of non-violent protest, a gesture many in the US recognize from recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed 18-year-old was shot to death by police.

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking “hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.
Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)
Still, the gesture has taken on new meaning for Hong Kong residents whose relationship with the city’s police may never be the same. Hong Kong is one of the most intensively policed cities in the world, with a police force of 30,000 that rivals New York City’s but serves a fraction of New York’s population. The last time Hong Kong authorities used tear gas against demonstrators was in 2005, during demonstrations outside of a World Trade Organization meeting, and in 1967, when leftist activists rioted throughout the city.
Now, residents are shocked by images of students being tear gassed and elderly demonstrators being pepper sprayed in the face, footage that has prompted more protesters to join demonstrations on Monday.",hong kong thousand pro democracy demonstration hong kong perhaps unwittingly united another protest movement mile away activist demanding free election semi autonomous territory holding hand air symbol non violent protest gesture many u recognize recent protest ferguson missouri unarmed year old shot death police hong kong protester purposefully mimicking hand shoot suggested instead gesture result training instruction protest leader told demonstrator raise hand palm forward signal peaceful intention police asked link gesture ferguson icy ng year old design student hong kong polytechnic university said think hand showing police medium weapon hand ng heard ferguson protest another demonstrator pro democracy group occupy central ellie ng said gesture nothing ferguson intended demonstrate hong kong protester peaceful unarmed mild important symbol movement may umbrella protester using protect pepper spray tear gas still gesture taken new meaning hong kong resident whose relationship city police may never hong kong one intensively policed city world police force rival new york city serf fraction new york population last time hong kong authority used tear gas demonstrator demonstration outside world trade organization meeting leftist activist rioted throughout city resident shocked image student tear gassed elderly demonstrator pepper sprayed face footage prompted protester join demonstration monday,protest ferguson missouri unarmed year old shot death police hong kong protester purposefully mimicking hand shoot suggested instead gesture result training instruction protest leader told demonstrator raise hand palm forward signal peaceful intention police asked link gesture ferguson icy ng year old design student hong kong polytechnic university said gesture nothing ferguson intended demonstrate hong kong protester peaceful unarmed mild important symbol movement may umbrella protester using protect pepper spray tear gas still gesture taken new meaning hong kong resident
363,"Freelance journalist Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by ISIS, Lee Ferran reported Tuesday for ABC News.

In the video, which appeared online today, Sotloff addresses the camera, saying, “I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing.”
“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?” Sotloff says calmly as the black clad militant holds a knife casually at his side.
On August 27, Sotloff’s mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading for her son’s release, Zeke Miller reported for Time. On August 22, Rick Gladstone and Shreeya Sinha wrote about Sotloff for The New York Times.

Described by friends as selfless, Mr. Sotloff spent most of his life in Florida except when he attended a boarding high school, Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he apparently developed a penchant for reporting and writing. He coedited the student newspaper, The Kimball Union, graduated in 2002 and attended the University of Central Florida, where he played rugby, worked for the independent student newspaper, Central Florida Future, and expressed deep interest in travel to the Middle East.
He left after three years and, soon after, began to pursue journalism full-time.

369,"The Islamic State group has made gains in Iraq, approaching the country's largest city Monday, as American-led airstrikes have hit the group's strongholds in Syria. The news of the bloodthirsty group's march towards Baghdad comes after President Obama admitted the U.S. underestimated the group — and overestimated the Iraqi Army.

The flood of Islamic State militants has reached Baghdad’s doors, reportedly just one mile from the Iraqi capital despite intense fighting and airstrikes to the west.

The growing and expanding terrorist group has gained ground over a large swath of Syria and Iraq, but ISIS entering the city of some 7 million people could prove disastrous to America and its allies hoping to stem the flow of the extremists.

That scenario is close to reality, according to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, a nonprofit supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, a priest leading the city’s only Anglican church.

“The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,” the group wrote Monday morning on Facebook. “They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear (sic) a very short while to know they can do very very little.”

ISIS has already taken control of Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, while fierce fighting is underway in Fallujah, a key town some 25 miles from Baghdad.

And Iraqi troops were battling ISIS some six miles west of Baghad, the BBC reported. But despite airstrike support, the army could barely contain the militants, much less force a retreat.

The news comes hours after President Obama admitted on “60 Minutes” that his administration, including intelligence services, “underestimated” the power and scope of the Islamic State, which has chewed up territory over the last three years across large parts of war-torn Syria and Iraq in a ruthless display of power.

“During the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you had huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos,” Obama said on .

ISIS is “sort of a hybrid of not just the terrorist network, but one with territorial ambitions, and some of the strategy and tactics of an army,” Obama said.

Now, military advisers have told the President ISIS boasts as many as 40,000 fighters who swear allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s goal of creating a new Islamic caliphate.

U.S.-led airstrikes overnight hit targets in the northern and eastern Syrian provinces of Aleppo, Raqqa, Hassakeh and Deir el-Zour in an attempt to wipe out the group’s oil, weapons and military facilities. Other strikes hit Iraq’s Anbar province.

But most dire may be the bloodthirsty group’s march on Baghdad.

“President Obama is saying that he overestimated the ability of the Iraqi Army,” Rev. White wrote on Facebook. “It is so clear they have no ability. A hard thing to say but its (sic) true.”

378,"Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, is planning to build its giant battery Gigafactory in Nevada after a five-state competition, a source who asked not to be identified confirms.

Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval has called press conference Thursday in Nevada's capitol in Carson City where the deal is expected to be announced.

The plant has been one of the nation's most highly sought projects among state economic development officials. Tesla, which has partnered with Japan's Panasonic, plans to spend $4 billion to $5 billion on the project and employ up to 6,500. The plant will make advanced batteries expected to power Tesla's next generation of electric cars.

Tesla recently confirmed that it has been excavating on a site near Reno, but stopped short of saying that it would be the site of the giant plant. In choosing Nevada, Tesla picks a location only a few hundred miles from its main assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which is close to its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.

The announcement comes after a weekend in which California's legislature adjourned without acting on a bill that could have delivered economic incentives to try to lure Tesla into building its battery plant in the Golden State.

Besides Nevada and California, other states named as finalists for the project included Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Tesla has indicated it may build a second battery factory as well.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that the company needs the Gigafactory, as he calls it, to dramatically lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries. The maker has indicated it was on a tight schedule to make sure the plant is running in time for start of production of its third model, the Model III, which would be aimed at mass-market car buyers. At present, Tesla makes only a single electric car model, the Model S, and is about to start production of an electric crossover, the Model X. Both of those vehicles, however, are aimed at high-end luxury buyers.

Tesla had no official comment Wednesday on the pending announcement. Spokesman Simon Sproule said, ""We continue to work with the state of Nevada.""",tesla motor electric car maker planning build giant battery gigafactory nevada five state competition source asked identified confirms nevada gov brian sandoval called press conference thursday nevada capitol carson city deal expected announced plant one nation highly sought project among state economic development official tesla partnered japan panasonic plan spend billion billion project employ plant make advanced battery expected power tesla next generation electric car tesla recently confirmed excavating site near reno stopped short saying would site giant plant choosing nevada tesla pick location hundred mile main assembly plant fremont calif close corporate headquarters palo alto announcement come weekend california legislature adjourned without acting bill could delivered economic incentive try lure tesla building battery plant golden state besides nevada california state named finalist project included texas new mexico arizona tesla indicated may build second battery factory well tesla ceo elon musk said company need gigafactory call dramatically lower cost lithium ion battery maker indicated tight schedule make sure plant running time start production third model model iii would aimed mass market car buyer present tesla make single electric car model model start production electric crossover model x vehicle however aimed high end luxury buyer tesla official comment wednesday pending announcement spokesman simon sproule said continue work state nevada,tesla build battery plant golden state besides nevada california state named finalist project included texas new mexico arizona tesla indicated may build second battery factory well tesla ceo elon musk said company need gigafactory call dramatically lower cost lithium ion battery maker indicated tight schedule make sure plant running time start production third model model iii would aimed high end luxury buyer tesla official comment wednesday pending
380,"A cat that was run down by a car and written off for dead apparently clawed its way out of the grave and made its way home to be fed.

Bart, a pet found on the street in a pool of blood more than a week ago, was pronounced dead by vets in Tampa, Florida.

But five days later he was outside owner Ellis Huston's house again expected dinner - albeit with a gruesome wound which makes him look the part for a member of the living dead - and means he will lose an eye.

Scroll down for video

Survivor: Bart, pictured, was pronounced dead, but clawed his way out of the grave and made it to his home in Tampa, Florida

Fighter: Rescuers say Bart probably came to underground and quickly got out - then hid for days before heading home

Hutson told local news station Fox13 that Bart suffered head trauma, a broken jaw and a ruined eye - but very much alive.

Though he still needs surgery before it can be certain he'll pull through, Bart's brush with death saw him escape a muddy grave.

It is unclear how he escaped, but Hutson is convinced that the battered feline who made his way to his neighbor's garden - then on home in the hope of a meal - is his revived pet.

Bart's eye will never work again - even if the surgery goes right - but his survival instincts are clearly on top form.

Rescuers at the Tampa Bay Humane Society, where he is being treated, believed he may have come to underground, escaped and then hid for a few days before gathering the courage to head home.

389,"A graphic circulating online claims that Mitt Romney said that Michelle Obama should be called ""First Woman"" instead of ""First Lady."" Is this true or false?

It’s not true.

Let’s first take a look at the meme which has been circulating heavily in January 2015.

“It’s false advertising to call Mrs. Obama the First Lady. First Woman, maybe, but certainly not a lady. Ann Romney is an actual lady.” – Mitt Romney, the Laura Ingraham Show 1/12/14.

romney first woman meme

Origin

The meme above was posted to the Facebook community “Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off” also known as “Stop the Tea Party.” That page posts a variety of outlandish memes with fictional political quotes. As of this writing, the page has about 40,000 likes. It appears that Romney, Michelle Bachmann, and Mike Huckabee are among the page’s favorite targets. The Romney meme above has been posted several times to this page.

Laura Ingraham

The date cited in the meme above – January 12, 2014 – was a Sunday, and the show’s archive of guests confirms that there was no show on that date, nor was Mitt Romney shown to be a guest at all that month. No reputable news sources have attribute such a quote to Romney.

Bottom Line

The quote attributed to Mitt Romney in which he allegedly said that Michelle Obama should be referred to as “First Woman” is not real.

392,"Four months after beheading American journalist James Foley, ISIS is ransoming his remains for $1 million, according to a new report by BuzzFeed.

Citing sources working as intermediaries for the militants and potential U.S. buyers, reporter Mike Giglio describes ""a grim new method of [ISIS] trying to secure funds"":

Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.

They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley's body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” one of Giglio's sources, a former Syrian rebel fighter, said. “They will not give the DNA without the money.” Another source, however, was more frank about his motivation in helping broker a deal, telling BuzzFeed, ""This is business.""

ISIS reportedly demanded $100 million for Foley's release before eventually beheading him and releasing the video online.

393,"Justin Bieber recently saved the life of a 42-year-old Russian man.

No, the Biebs didn’t do anything heroic. When Igor Vorozhbitsyn was en route to his favorite fishing spot in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, he was attacked by a huge brown bear.

But then, his cell phone rang and the ringtone, “Baby,” scared off the animal.

As the bear started clawing violently at Vorozhbitsyn, the Biebs’ pre-pubescent vocals made the bear’s ears bleed, and it ran off.

Wildlife experts believe it was the fact that the ringtone sounding off was so unexpected that it spooked the bear, but it’s more fun to say the bear just really, really, hated that song.

Vorozhbitsyn suffers from severe bruises on his chest and face and cuts on his neck. Other fishermen found him after he was attacked, and used his phone to call for help.

Vorozhbitsyn says he knows the ringtone “isn’t to everyone’s taste,” but it was his granddaughter that loaded “Baby” onto his phone “for a joke.”

I think, however, that’s just code for “I’m honestly just a true Belieber.”

The report, which cited unidentified industry sources, said LG Display will be the sole supplier of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple Watch that go on sale in April.

Samsung Display will also become a supplier for the next version of the smartwatch that is expected to go on sale either sometime in the second half of this year or early 2016, the South Korean newspaper said.

LG Display and Samsung Display declined to comment on the report. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

Apple has scheduled a special event on March 9, where it is expected to showcase Apple Watch.

411,"The nation awoke this morning (Monday) to headlines of children imitating dogs in fights at a local school and, unfortunately, the story seems to be true.While the Addie cannot name the school or those involved as they are all minors, the paper can confirm that, according to Wendy Wilson of the NSPCA, the organisation was called in, in June to handle this situation.When they arrived at the school to investigate, Wendy says she witnessed the children fighting so there can be no doubt that the fights were taking place.While the NSPCA is unsure how long the fighting had been taking place before they were alerted to this cruel “game” Wendy has confirmed that the NSPCA was contacted by the Springs SPCA last June to make her aware of children at a Springs school imitating dog fights.However, when contacted for comment, Celeste Kleyn, manager from the Springs Springs SPCA, says they are not aware of the incidents.“Our investigations revealed that the children were  engaging in both real dog fighting activities outside of school hours as well as role play whilst at school,” says Wendy.“Animals fighting always results in animals being harmed and suffering no matter the level of sophistication it is taking place at.“The issue was brought to our attention by a very observant and proactive principal as there are animal victims involved as well,” Wendy commented adding, “”The SPCAs mandate is to ensure the welfare of animals as well as their protection.“Were there is animal abuse of this nature you will find co-current abuses of vulnerable humans.”All the children involved in this situation are of primary school age, and investigations indicated that all these children were first exposed to the activity of dog fighting by either older children or adults in the community during their primary school years.According to Wendy, this is the first time she or her colleagues have come across this type of “dog fighting” with humans acting as the dogs.The NSPCA brought the situation to the attention of the different SAPS Units and Social Services and workshops were conducted with invitations extended to local SAPS, Social Services, Child Protection, Department of Justice, Community leaders, School Principals and local SPCAs.These workshops addressed aspects such as recognising animal cruelty and the link that it has with violence towards humans, dog fighting and other organised animal crime, animal cruelty and children, societies role and responsibility with regards to animal protection in South Africa.Wendy says that the principle ensured the NSPCA that the fighting role play had been stopped at the school but, she says, the children could still be engaging in the activity outside of school hours.When asked about the adults involved, Wendy said that the adults organising the fights are all members of the immediate community and are known dog fighters in the community.She says the children are forced to watch dogs fighting over weekends and then, once at school, are forced to re-enact the fights.The children are also encouraged to bet on the outcome of these fights involving children going down on all fours, growling and snapping at one another, and in some instances injuring one another.Further, it is believed that the prize, for the winning child fighter, is a younger child with whom they are encouraged to “mate”.The truth of this is, however, unclear as Webdy comments: “I saw the act of canine copulation enacted but I do not know how far this is taken when the children are alone.“As I understand it from the children, different children are used as the female dogs but most often it tends to be the younger ones who are forced into this role.”Captain Johannes Ramphora, spokesperson for the Springs police told the Addie that he unaware of this situation and whether or not the police are involved in an investigation into the matter.",nation awoke morning monday headline child imitating dog fight

412,"A 9-year-old girl has stunned her teacher by penning him a touching note after he came out to his class as gay.

The teacher told the class of primary school children about his sexuality after the majority of his students admitted to having heard the word ‘gay’ used in a derogatory way and believing that gay men and lesbians were bad or in some way wrong, during a class on bullying and homophobia.

He explained to Pink News: ‘After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I’m gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.’

And although the news was well received by the class, he was taken aback when the unnamed student slipped him this heartfelt note a few days later.

The note opens with the line, ‘Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now’, and concludes, ‘You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everone in the class feels the same way as I do’

The teacher told Pink News: ‘Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.’

What an inspirational little girl.

415,"A woman has been arrested after she reportedly chopped off her cheating husband's penis twice.

According to The Mirror, the woman flew into a rage once she discovered her 32-year-old husband, father of five children, had been having an affair.

Fan Lung reportedly used his wife's phone to send photos to his mistress, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, in the city of Shangqiu.

But his wife Feng, 30, found the image and in a rage grabbed the scissors and stormed into the room where he was sleeping, and attacked him.

He was taken to hospital and emergency surgery was performed - but the wife returned to the hospital and cut it off for a second time, reportedly throwing it out of the window where it was lost.

According to The Mirror, a hospital spokesman said: ""The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital.

""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

""He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.""

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man’s missing member. They believed it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman added: ""The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

""He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.""

The man's lover visited him in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

She said: ""It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility, he has five children already.""

420,"FISHERMAN Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive - after his Justin Bieber ringtone went off while he was being attacked by a bear.

Mr Vorozhbitsyn, 42, thought he was a goner when the brown bear pounced on him as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic.

But as the bear began to claw at him, Mr Vorozhbitsyn's mobile went off and the beast turned tail and fled back into the forest.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone - according to local media the singer's hit Baby - must have startled the bear into halting its attack.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" explained one.

Mr Vorozhbitsyn suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.

Mr Vorozhbitsyn - now recovering from his mauling - said: ""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.

""I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled.

421,"Tree Afghan soldiers, who went missing while in Massachusetts for military training, have been found trying to cross the border into Canada, a defense department official said on Monday.

“I can confirm that the Canadians have them,” the defense official said.
The Afghan officers were reported missing late Saturday after a trip to a shopping mall in Hyannis, Mass., about 20 miles from Joint Base Cape Cod where they were involved in a training exercise. Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers disappeared from a DEA training program in Quantico, Va. and were found several days later in the area.

In both cases, the Afghans were part of a chaperoned group that was taken to see U.S. sights and culture, officials said. Both groups were vetted by U.S. officials before they were allowed into the United States.

“There is no indication they pose any threat to the public,” the military said of the trio of officers.

The three were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminy. They arrived at Joint Base Cape Cod on Sept. 11. In addition to Afghanistan, personnel also arrived from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

The exercises took place at Camp Edwards, home to the Massachusetts National Guard and part of Joint Base Cape Cod, which includes a replica of an operating base used by soldiers in areas like Afghanistan.

The training, known as Exercise Regional Cooperation 2014, is one of a series of annual events, sponsored by the U.S. Central Command. Such training has taken place every year since 2004; last year’s exercise was Germany.

The visitors get days off, such as Saturday, the military said. The Afghans were taken to the mall to sight-see and observe aspects of U.S. culture, the spokeswoman said.

On Sept. 13, two Afghan policemen went missing in Washington, D.C., while visiting the U.S. for training in narcotics law-enforcement techniques, Joseph Moses, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The two Afghan officers, who were said to be looking for a better life, were on a chaperoned visit to Washington's Georgetown section when they went off. They were found a few days later and returned to the training program, which ended last week.


The police had been vetted before they arrived and found to be clear of all criminal ties, Moses said.

The incident marked the first time any police had gone missing among the thousands of foreign officers who have received additional training in Quantico, Va., according to authorities.",tree afghan soldier went missing massachusetts military training found trying cross border canada defense department official said monday confirm canadian defense official said afghan officer reported missing late saturday trip shopping mall hyannis mass mile joint base cape cod involved training exercise earlier month two afghan police officer disappeared dea training program quantico va found several day later area case afghan part chaperoned group taken see u sight culture official said group vetted u official allowed united state indication pose threat public military said trio officer lrelated kerry warned feuding afghan would consequence afghanistan pakistan kerry warned feuding afghan would consequence see related three identified maj jan mohammad arash capt mohammad nasir askarzada capt noorullah aminy arrived joint base cape cod sept addition afghanistan personnel also arrived tajikistan pakistan kazakhstan mongolia exercise took place camp edward home massachusetts national guard part joint base cape cod includes replica operating base used soldier area like afghanistan training known exercise regional cooperation one series annual event sponsored u central command training taken place every year since last year exercise germany visitor get day saturday military said afghan taken mall sight see observe aspect u culture spokeswoman said sept two afghan policeman went missing washington c visiting u training narcotic law enforcement technique joseph moses special agent drug enforcement administration two afghan officer said looking better life chaperoned visit washington georgetown section went found day later returned training program ended last week police vetted arrived found clear criminal tie moses said incident marked first time police gone missing among thousand foreign officer received additional training quantico va according authority,afghan officer reported missing saturday trip shopping mall hyannis mass mile joint base cape cod involved training exercise earlier month two afghan police officer disappeared dea training program quantico va found several day later area case afghan part chaperoned group taken see u sight culture official said group vetted u official allowed united state indication pose threat public military said trio officer lrelated kerry warned feuding afghan would consequence afghanistan pak

426,"The War on Christmas moved to a new battleground this week—a domestic American Airlines flight, where passengers and flight attendants alike alighted with Christmas cheer to overcome a dark force muddling its way down the aisle.

According to the New York Post, the skirmish began when a LaGuardia gate attendant who innocently wished a passenger on a Dallas-bound flight a ""Merry Christmas"" Tuesday.

The grumpy passenger, who appeared to be traveling alone, barked at the woman, ""You shouldn't say that because not everyone celebrates Christmas.""

The agent replied, ""Well, what should I say then?""

""Don't say, 'Merry Christmas!' "" the man shouted before brushing past her.

But the fight was not yet won.

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a ""merry Christmas."" That was the last straw.

""Don't say, 'Merry Christmas!' "" the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

When the man wouldn't stop his ""hectoring"", the flight crew reportedly turned to the only weapon left in their arsenal—Christmas cheer (and aviation martial law). As staffers began escorting the grinch off the plane, passengers reportedly caught the spirit. We believe in Christmas, they clapped, their shining faces burning with fervor as they reportedly ""burst into cheers and applause."" All is well! All is bright! What'd you get me?

429,"Hewlett-Packard is now forging ahead with plans to split off its PC-and-printer businesses into a separate company, with the rest of the company’s enterprise portfolio staying together in a separate entity to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the company said early Monday morning.

The Hewlett-Packard enterprise unit, comprising servers, storage, networking, converged systems, services and software and the OpenStack Helion cloud, will be led by Meg Whitman as president and CEO. Pat Russo will be chairman of that board.

The PC and printer entity, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler as president and CEO, with Whitman as chairman. The Wall Street Journal (registration required) was first to report this news Sunday afternoon.

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” Whitman said in a statement. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders.”

HP, truly an iconic IT company, has been slammed in the past decade by the shift to mobile devices and cloud and a series of management fiascos including the short-lived tenure of former CEO Leo Apotheker. Under his watch, the company considered selling off its still huge PC business, a plan that was scotched by Whitman when she took the reins in 2011. The rationale behind holding onto the PC business was that it gave HP huge volume buying power advantages in procuring chips and other components for its server business as well.

Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in a note that while a split up of HP is hardly a new topic, his take is that the spin off  seems to be “fueled by weakness at HP rather than strength.” He also noted that HP in the past few months “came close” to buying Rackspace for nearly $6 billion; nearly bought EMC and “apparently has shopped various parts of its portfolio PCs, its Unix business, IT Services.”

In another research report released before the news was official, Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote:

We believe a separation may suggest HP could become more active in both divestitures and acquisitions, which we believed would be increasingly necessary in FY2015. While this is somewhat of an about face from its prior stance that it was “better together”, we believe this, if true, is likely to be driven by competitive market dynamics as well as a stabilization in its PC business.
The separation, which HP said will be tax-free to shareholders in terms of federal income taxes, is slated to be done by the end of HP’s 2015 fiscal year, ending October 31, 2015.

The young famous soldier defended Kobani over the past few weeks and killed over 100 ISIS militants. Rehana’s picture holding her gun and making a V-sign was widely-distributed on social networks and now another picture of an ISIS militant holding her head is making the rounds.

It is estimated that female fighters form about 30% of the Kurds defending Kobani. All of them are volunteers according to the leader of the female fighters, Mayass Abdo.

435,"The jihadist group the Islamic State is trying to sell the body of US journalist James Foley for a reported $1 million.

The extremist terrorist organization executed Foley in a gruesome beheading video in August. Two more US citizens — American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig — have followed, as well as two UK nationals David Haine and Alan Henning, both aid workers as well.


Foley’s was the first in a series of the grisly, publicized executions that shocked many in the West. British journalist John Cantile and an unnamed 26-year-old American woman remain in IS captivity.

IS offered to provide a DNA sample and transfer Foley’s body to Turkey, BuzzFeed reported Wednesday, in a piece detailing exchanges with “middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),” using another name for the marauding group which has murdered and plundered its way to controlling large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.

One of the “middlemen,” a Syrian rebel, told BuzzFeed he was approached by an IS commanders seeking to make the deal with the US government or with Foley’s family. The man, who reportedly managed hostage negotiations with the al-Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front, said the motivation was to provide closure for the family, “a humanity case”

Another intermediary was much more to the point, telling the popular site: “This is business.”

A third point-person mentioned in the report was an official in the US-backed Free Syrian Army rebel group, who urged the site not to publish details of a potential deal for fear it could be sabotaged.

“It will be like a shame for the US government,” the FSA official told BuzzFeed. “People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.”

The Islamic State has made a lucrative business of hostage taking — reportedly trading 15 European nationals and others for between $35-45 million earlier this year (and killing the ones whose governments would not negotiate) — but this report indicates the terror group has turned a revolting new page.

“They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,” the FSA official said, according to the report.

The group is not starved for funds, however, with its ransom business, black market oil sales and tax collection raking in up to $800 million per year, according to reports.

Just this week, analysts said the terror organization spent no less than an estimated $200,000 on a propaganda video that featured the beheading of 22 Syrian soldiers, and that took between four and six hours to film.

The propaganda video, released on November 16 and called “Though the Unbelievers Despise It,” shows the simultaneous executions of the Syrian soldiers as well as the beheading of Kassig.

In the video, the killers appear to be led by a masked “Jihadi John,” the British IS militant believed to be responsible for the beheadings of  Kassig, as well as Foley, Sotloff, Haine and Henning.

In light of the large numbers of radicalized foreigners who have joined the Islamic State, analysts from all over the world have been studying the clip in an effort to identify the rest of the killers.

436,"The Supreme Leader has been out of action for three weeks, making his last appearance in public on September 3.

And now people are asking whether his unhealthy obsession with Emmental cheese is behind the secret condition.

Mr Kim missed a session at North Korea's law-making body, the Supreme People's Assembly, this week - the first time he has been absent since taking power in 2011.

He was last seen with a limp at Moranbong Band concert earlier this month, with speculation that he had ballooned in size as a result of his unhealthy diet.

South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the 31-year-old was ""suffering from gout, along with hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure"".

They attributed his condition to a large amount of drinking and overeating - relating it to his dangerously high consumption of cheese.

Emmental, or Swiss cheese, is made up of 45% fat and large quantities of it can lead to a number of serious health issues.
The leader is said to have gained a habit of munching on the unhealthy dairy product in recent years, which may be a reason behind his disappearance.

A Korean source said last week: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

Cho Myung-Chul, a former researcher at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said he ""probably eats much more than the average North Korean"".

He added: ""North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.""

Rumours spread that his recent disappearance may have been linked to a sport injury or that he was just on holiday.

And other say the leader may be intentionally gaining weight to look like bloated grandfather Kim Il-sung, who achieved cult status for his national reform in the 1980s.

Mr Cho said: ""There is a high possibility Jong-Un intentionally gained weight to look like Kim Il-sung.""",supreme leader action three week making last appearance public september people asking whether unhealthy obsession emmental cheese behind secret condition mr kim missed session north korea law making body supreme people assembly week first time absent since taking power last seen limp moranbong band concert earlier month speculation ballooned size result unhealthy diet south korean news agency yonhap reported year old suffering gout along hyperuricemia hyperlipidemia obesity diabetes high blood pressure attributed condition large amount drinking overeating relating dangerously high consumption cheese emmental swiss cheese made fat large quantity lead number serious health issue leader said gained habit munching unhealthy dairy product recent year may reason behind disappearance korean source said last week intake increased recent year strain power cho myung chul former researcher korea institute international economic policy said probably eats much average north korean added north korean think fat good unlike south korean want skinny rumour spread recent disappearance may linked sport injury holiday say leader may intentionally gaining weight look like bloated grandfather kim il sung achieved cult status national reform mr cho said high possibility jong un intentionally gained weight look like kim il sung,kim missed session north korea law making body supreme people assembly week first time absent since taking power last seen limp moranbong band concert earlier month speculation ballooned size result unhealthy diet emmental cheese behind secret condition mr kim missed session north korea law making body supreme people assembly week first time absent since taking power last seen limp moranbong band concert earlier month speculation ballooned size result unhealthy diet mr kim missed session north korea law making body supreme
437,"Dornella Conner was travelling through the mayhem on Monday night, when a cop shot a non-lethal bean bag round at her boyfriend's car

A pregnant woman has lost an eye after cops reportedly fired a BEAN BAG round through a car window during the Ferguson riots.

Violence erupted in the Missouri city of Ferguson earlier this week following a grand jury decision that white policeman Darren Wilson should not face trial for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The destruction and looting that followed is believed to have cost the city millions in repair bills - and several lives have been lost.

Dornella Conner was travelling through the mayhem in the St. Louis suburb on Monday night, when a cop is reported to have fired a non-lethal bean bag round at her boyfriend's car, which smashed the window and left her with severe injuries.

Reuters   Mayhem: Violence flared in the city of Ferguson after the verdict

“I will have justice for what they did to me,” Ms Conner wrote on Facebook on Thursday following the incident. “But I’m happy I’m alive.”

Ms Conner and her boyfriend were parked a BP petrol station when police moved in to clear the area, the New York Daily News reports.

Officers made 16 arrests after reporting gunfire coming from the petrol station.

Mirror correspondent witnesses the riots:

Police claim a driver tried to run over a cop who then fired at the car in fear for his safety.

Ms Conner's told KMOV that her boyfriend was trying to drive around police so they could escape the violence at the time.

Ms Conner's injured eye could not be saved, and she has blurred vision in the other.

Police have reportedly issued a warrant for her boyfriend's arrest.

She claims the couple were just bystanders who were caught up in the mayhem.

439,"An unconfirmed explosion at a Saudi Arabian oil pipeline briefly sent crude prices higher on Wednesday but the market shrugged off the scare, signalling once again traders' concerns over falling demand.

Pictures of the blast at a small domestic pipeline near Riyadh were posted on Twitter, sending prices of North Sea crude up almost $2 within minutes, before the benchmark fell back to its previous trading range. Brent had been trading down around 0.5pc at just over $82 per barrel before the blast.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter of crude and has the capacity to pump up to 12.5m barrels per day (bpd) of oil. The kingdom is the most influential member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) as it accounts for about a third of the group's supplies.

The unconfirmed pipeline blast follows a period of violence in Saudi Arabia's volotile Eastern Province, where much of its oil is produced. Masked men are understood to have killed at least five people earlier this week in a Shiite village near the town of Qatif, which is a predominantly Shia area of the Sunni-Muslim controlled kingdom.

Some traders believe that Saudi is willing to tolerate lower oil prices partly to defend the kingdom's share of the energy market in the US, the world's largest economy.

""The largest and most influential Opec producer seems more interested in defending its market shares in an oversupplied market, as well as wishing to curb the shale oil supply flooding the market from the US,"" said Commerzbank. ""To this end, Saudi Arabia is evidently prepared to accept lower oil prices for a certain period of time.""

441,"The 28-year-old took to Instagram Wednesday to blast a story on a parody site that stated she claimed Cosby molested her when they both appeared on 'The Cosby Show.’ ‘This is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of,’ Symone wrote.

Raven-Symone was the subject of a tasteless joke related to Bill Cosby's rape scandal — and she took to Instagram to fire back.

The fake news site Hip-Hop Hangover posted a story this week alleging that the actress had filed molestation charges against Cosby when both appeared on ""The Cosby Show."" The article claimed the incident occurred after the 1992 series finale, when she would have been around 6 years old.

While the site has a disclaimer page in which it describes itself as a “gossip parody and satirical publication,” it seems enough people were taking the report seriously that Symone felt compelled to speak out.

On Wednesday, the 28-year-old blasted the report on her Instagram account.

I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!

A photo posted by Raven-Symone` (@ravensymonecp) on Nov 11, 2014 at 2:20pm PST

“I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show!,” she captioned a photo of her “Cosby Show” character Olivia.

“I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of!” she added.

“Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!”

Symone is the first “Cosby Show” star pulled into her co-star's ongoing scandal. Three women, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson, have publicly accused Cosby of assault after comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a stand-up gig in Philadelphia last month.

In response to the backlash against the comedian, Netflix announced Tuesday it was postponing airing a stand-up comedy special featuring Cosby called “Bill Cosby 77.” On Wednesday, NBC confirmed it had dropped plans to develop a new primetime comedy starring the actor.

448,"Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wants to put an end to werewolf bar mitzvahs once and for all.

Kirchner adopted Argentinian teen Yair Tawil as her godson as part of a folktale that says the seventh-born son in a family will turn into a werewolf and eat unbaptized babies, the New York Daily News reports.

This may sound familiar to fans of 30 Rock:

Source: YouTube

Wait, what? According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobizon,"" the Independent explains. The werewolf-like beast ""shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.""

The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.


The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a ""magical moment,"" calling the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""

But are they more marvelous than this?

449,"This story originally appeared in The Daily Mail:
Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital - despite ongoing Western airstrikes against the terror group.
The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday.
ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate.
Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.
In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.
'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added.
The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.
In a message he also posted on Facebook, Canon White had said: 'The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing. If ever we needed your prayer it is now.'
The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad.
But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbs for this morning's fighting.

457,"Saudi Arabia airlines has a new passenger plan: Segregation. The Arab state’s national airlines plans to introduce the gender segregation, proving just how far behind the western Asian nation is when it comes to human rights. Complaints were reportedly received by the airlines of men sitting next to their spouses. In Saudi Arabia, one of the very few countries that have rejected adoption of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it’s customary for a female to walk a few feet behind her male counterpart.

Writes RT.com on Jan. 2: “Airline company Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women separated onboard, unless they are close relatives, the Emirates247 news website reported. ‘There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,’ Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, according to Saudi daily Ajel.”

The proposed rule from the Gulf kingdom is in line with strict interpretations of Islamic practices. The complaints were allegedly aired by single, Saudi men who saw other married men sitting directly next to their spouses or female strangers. The airlines has issued an updated set of regulations “to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place,” writes the Daily Mail.

The carrier already has number of Islamic guidelines in place – the airline does not offer alcohol (or pork dishes), a prayer from the Quran is uttered before the flight leaves the tarmac, and some flights have an area on the plane designated as a “male prayer zone.” The airlines also will not hire any women from Saudi Arabia – they are employed from surrounding countries only.

The Daily Mail picks up the story: The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors. Women who are seen socializing with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

UK’s ""The Week,"" in September, published an article entitled Eleven things women in Saudi Arabia can't do. While not the case in all parts of the country, the article says women are unable to walk without a male chaperone, vote, swim, drive, or try on clothes in a store, among other restrictions.",saudi arabia airline new passenger plan segregation arab state national airline plan introduce gender segregation proving far behind western asian nation come human right complaint reportedly received airline men sitting next spouse saudi arabia one country rejected adoption un universal declaration human right customary female walk foot behind male counterpart writes rt com jan airline company saudia order staff keep men woman separated onboard unless close relative emirate news website reported solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger saudia assistant manager marketing abdul rahman al fahd said according saudi daily ajel proposed rule gulf kingdom line strict interpretation islamic practice complaint allegedly aired single saudi men saw married men sitting directly next spouse female stranger airline issued updated set regulation flight booking staff gulf airport keep new rule place writes daily mail carrier already number islamic guideline place airline offer alcohol pork dish prayer quran uttered flight leaf tarmac flight area plane designated male prayer zone airline also hire woman saudi arabia employed surrounding country daily mail pick story country known gender segregation woman requiring male guardian approval travel work outside home public space restaurant beach amusement park bank woman required enter exit special door woman seen socializing man relative even charged committing adultery fornication prostitution uk week september published article entitled eleven thing woman saudi arabia case part country article say woman unable walk without male chaperone vote swim drive try clothes store among restriction,saudi arabia airline new passenger plan segregation arab state national airline plan introduce gender segregation proving far behind western asian nation come human right complaint reportedly received airline men sitting next spouse saudi arabia one country rejected adoption un universal declaration human right customary female walk foot behind male counterpart writes rt com jan airline company saudia order staff keep men separated onboard unless close relative emirate news website reported solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger saudi arabia employed surrounding country

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the two journalists beheaded by ISIS, claim the Obama administration threatened to prosecute them if they tried to free the men on their own. ISIS had demanded ransom money in exchange for their kidnapped victims, though such payments are illegal as they are considered to be material support for terrorism.

469,"Many people haven’t even gotten their iPhone 6 devices yet, and already the rumors are starting up about what Apple has planned for its next generation handsets.

One slightly sketchy rumor, citing sources in the Apple supply chain in China, suggests 2015’s iPhone lineup could include a 4-inch model, in line with the size of the iPhone 5 and 5s. According to the report, the idea would be to appeal to “female users” who are put off by the larger screen size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

The rumor doesn’t elaborate on whether Apple would create a new 4-inch iPhone from scratch, or refresh a previously launched model instead.

We’re not convinced!

Personally, I’d suggest the report is 99 percent likely to be nonsense. Apple only just upgraded to the larger screen size with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, to both critical and commercial acclaim. Between them, the two handsets smashed records with 10 million+ sales in their first weekend on sale, and analysts are predicting 71.5 million more units will sell over the holidays.

For all the criticisms we’ve heard about the new iPhones, virtually none have suggested both handsets are too big for a substantial portion of users. Larger “phablet” phones have also consistently shown themselves to be the fastest-growing smartphone category — and particularly popular in Asia, which is where Apple is focused on expanding its presence in.",many people even gotten iphone device yet already rumor starting apple planned next generation handset one slightly sketchy rumor citing source apple supply chain china suggests iphone lineup could include inch model line size iphone according report idea would appeal female user put larger screen size iphone plus rumor elaborate whether apple would create new inch iphone scratch refresh previously launched model instead convinced personally suggest report percent likely nonsense apple upgraded larger screen size iphone plus critical commercial acclaim two handset smashed record million sale first weekend sale analyst predicting million unit sell holiday criticism heard new iphones virtually none suggested handset big substantial portion user larger phablet phone also consistently shown fastest growing smartphone category particularly popular asia apple focused expanding presence,rumor citing source apple supply chain china suggests iphone lineup could include inch model line size iphone according report idea would appeal female user put larger screen size iphone plus rumor elaborate whether apple would create new inch iphone scratch refresh previously launched model instead convinced personally suggest report percent likely nonsense apple upgraded larger screen size iphone plus critical commercial acclaim two handset smashed record million sale first weekend sale analyst predict million unit sell holiday criticism heard new iphones virtually none suggested handset big substantial portion user larger phablet phone also consistently shown fastest growing
471,"According to the SITE Intel Group, ISIS has executed a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff:

#IS Beheads Steven Joel #Sotloff, Threatens to Execute Briton David Cawthorne Haines — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) September 2, 2014

The killing comes just weeks after the extremist group in Iraq killed U.S. journalist James Wright Foley. At the end of the video in which Foley was shown being killed on camera, ISIS fighters showed Sotloff kneeling, wearing the same orange garb. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the man in the video said.

Last week, Shirley Sotloff, the mother of the 31-year-old journalist, released a video message to ISIS in which she begged for their mercy.

“I am sending this message to you, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Quraishi al-Hussaini, the caliph of the Islamic State. I am Shirley Sotloff. My son Steven is in your hands,” she said in the video. “You, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child,” she continues. “I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.”

Sotloff, who worked for Time magazine, was kidnapped in Aleppo, Syria in 2013 and was being held hostage by ISIS until his death this week. The group is now threatening to kill another hostage, British journalist David Cawthorne Haines.

473,"The luxury version of the Apple Watch, made from 18-carat rose or yellow gold, will be kept in safes within stores, according to sources.

The Apple Watch Edition is expected to retail for thousands, and will go on sale with the standard Apple Watch and Apple Watch by April, Tim Cook confirmed last week. In a bid to keep the expensive timepieces secure Apple has begun installing safes in stores, sources told 9to5Mac. UK pricing is yet to be announced, but the Sports model will retail in the US from $349 (£230).

The safes will come equipped with Apple's patented MagSafe magnetic chargers to recharge demo models, as well as boxed stock.

Apple is said to be sending two employees from stores across the US to training sessions in Cupertino, California and Texas from mid-February, and will be developing ways of demonstrating the Watch to customers on the shop floor.

In a video message to retail staff in November last year, senior vice president of retail and online stores Angela Ahrendts told staff to prepare for ""a new watch launch coming in the spring"" - leading analysts to believe the Apple Watch, announced at the iPhone 6 launch event, would go on sale in the first three months or so of 2015.

Apple had previously said to expect a launch in 'early 2015' when the watch was first unveiled at the launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus last September.

The Watch will come in three versions - the Apple Watch Sport in grey or silver anodized aluminium, the standard Apple Watch in polished or black stainless steel, and the luxury Watch Edition, available in rose or yellow 18 carat gold developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold.

479,"All was going well at the wedding ceremony of 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, a resident of Moradabad, and his 23-year-old bride Indira from Rampur. That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.
Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering. The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishore's medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.
Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the ""varmala"" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven ""pheras"".
Meanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.
Kishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used — spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm.
Kishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district, which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO, Milak police station, RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding. ""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" Solanki said. ""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.""",going well wedding ceremony year old jugal kishore resident moradabad year old bride indira rampur varmala ceremony groom garland would wife began extended arm kishore epileptic fit falling ground front whole gathering young bride angry family kept dark kishore medical condition promptly changed mind announced would happily marry ceremony guest wedding man called harpal singh latter incidentally turned sister brother law singh caught unawares dressed jean leather jacket fumbled moment declaring would willingly take indira wife time varmala exchanged singh indira went without hitch pandit reciting mantra asking new couple take seven pheras meanwhile kishore rushed doctor relative went back venue regained consciousness see wife someone else kishore pleaded indira telling would able face friend neighbour returned without relative tried intervene behalf persuasion failed violence used spoon plate dish became weapon wedding guest tried force bride change mind vain young woman stood firm kishore relative later filed fir milak police station rampur district eventually withdrew elder intervened sho milak police station rp solanki said monday cop detained people wedding family amicably resolved matter solanki said complaint withdrawn kishore family returned peace moradabad,bride indira rampur varmala ceremony groom garland would wife began extended arm kishore epileptic fit falling ground front whole gathering young bride angry family kept dark kishore medical condition promptly changed mind announced would happily marry ceremony guest wedding man called harpal singh latter incidentally turned sister brother law singh caught unawares dressed jean leather jacket fumbled moment declaring would willingly take indira wife time varmala exchanged singh indira went without hitch pandit re

486,"In what is being called the largest corporate jobs cull in history, IBM is set to axe more than 111,000 of its staff this week.

Dubbed Project Chrome internally at IBM, the process will see 26% of the company's workforce laid off in one fell swoop, meaning that 111,800 people could lose their jobs before the end of January based on IBM's global workforce of 430,000.

News of the job cuts come from veteran Silicon Valley reporter Robert X. Cringely, who recently published a book entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM.

RelatedIBM inks $1.25bn cloud computing deal with WPPLenovo Buys IBM's X86 Server BusinessApple-IBM Deal: Why iPad-Maker is Doubling Down on Enterprise

In his report on Project Chrome, Cringely says that those affected by the cuts ""will all be gone by the end of February"". He said that while there would be a significant number of jobs lost in the US, the axe would fall on all of IBM's locations around the world. The cuts in the US are likely to affect the company's mainframe and storage divisions most dramatically.

Falling revenue

Currently the record for the largest single corporate lay-off is also held by IBM, having fired more than 60,000 of its workforce in 1993, but this would be dwarfed if Cringely's predictions come true.

Last year Microsoft hit the headlines when it had its largest ever jobs cull when it laid off more than 18,000 staff in one go.

IBM's problems were underscored last week when it announced another set of weak quarterly revenue figures, its eleventh straight quarter of declining revenue.

Following those results, CEO Ginni Rometty said the company was in transition but made no mention of the huge job cuts: ""We are making significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM's business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term.""

IBM's problems stem from the fact that customers are moving their storage infrastructure to the cloud, meaning they no longer need physical data centres on site and therefore don't need service contracts with IBM to help maintain them - a business which accounts for two-thirds of IBM's revenue.",called largest corporate job cull history ibm set axe staff week dubbed project chrome internally ibm process see company workforce laid one fell swoop meaning people could lose job end january based ibm global workforce news job cut come veteran silicon valley reporter robert x cringely recently published book entitled decline fall ibm relatedibm ink bn cloud computing deal wpplenovo buy ibm x server businessapple ibm deal ipad maker doubling enterprise report project chrome cringely say affected cut gone end february said would significant number job lost u axe would fall ibm location around world cut u likely affect company mainframe storage division dramatically falling revenue currently record largest single corporate lay also held ibm fired workforce would dwarfed cringely prediction come true last year microsoft hit headline largest ever job cull laid staff one go ibm problem underscored last week announced another set weak quarterly revenue figure eleventh straight quarter declining revenue following result ceo ginni rometty said company transition made mention huge job cut making significant progress transformation continuing shift ibm business higher value investing positioning longer term ibm problem stem fact customer moving storage infrastructure cloud meaning longer need physical data centre site therefore need service contract ibm help maintain business account two third ibm revenue,ibm global workforce news job cut come veteran silicon valley reporter robert x cringely recently published book entitled decline fall ibm relatedibm ink bn cloud computing deal wpplenovo buy ibm x server businessapple ibm deal ipad maker doubling enterprise report project chrome cringely say affected cut gone end february said would significant number job lost u axe would fall ibm location around world cut u
489,"Claim: An aerial photograph shows a giant 50-foot crab off the coast of Whitstable, UK.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via Twitter, October 2014] Crabzilla! Photo appears 2 show giant CRAB measuring at least 50ft across lurking i/t waters off Whitstable"" Really? pic.twitter.com/xzcrZcoY7Q— Babble (@GibberishBabble) October 13, 2014

Origins: A photograph of a giant 50-foot crab, dubbed Crabzilla, went viral after it was published in the UK newspaper Sunday Express on 12 October 2014.

The aerial photograph of Crabzilla was originally posted to Weird Whitstable , a website dedicated to strange sightings in the Kent area, back in 2013. The blog posted a second photo of crabzilla in July 2014 which showed two enormous crab claws reaching out of the water:

This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend. The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.

Quinton Winter, the curator of Weird Whitstable , told the Express Times that he was skeptical about the photos when he first saw them. That changed last summer, however, when he spotted the giant crab for himself:

At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that's a funny looking bit of driftwood.' It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.

Despite Winter's claim, most likely the Crabzilla photo is just the results of some digital fakery.

According to the Marine Biological Association of the UK, the Japanese spider crab is the largest crab species in the world. These crabs can grow up to 3.7 meters across, which, while incredibly large for a crab, is about 11.5 meters (37 feet) smaller than the estimated size of Crabzilla:

The crab in the viral photo appears to be a cancer pagurus, which is commonly known as a brown or edible crab. These crabs are common in the Whitstable area, but they only grow to about 10 inches wide. Graphic artist Ashley Austen told Kent Online that someone probably used Photoshop and a brown crab image to create the Crabzilla photo:

The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the 'artist' had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.

There is no other proof confirming that Crabzilla exists. Judging by the image source, the unbelievable size, and the fact that this picture could easily be created with Photoshop, we have to rate the Crabzilla photograph as a likely fake.

491,"Apple may boost the amount of internal RAM and use faster LPDDR4 RAM technology in its next-generation iPhone 6s, claims TechNews Taiwan (via G Gor Games). These RAM modules offer low power consumption and a significant performance increase over the 1GB of LPDDR3 RAM used in the current-generation iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

iphone6-stock
According to supply chain sources, the LPDDR4 RAM modules for the iPhone 6s will be supplied primarily by Hynix, Samsung, and Micron-Elpida. Elpida reportedly was behind schedule, but the company allegedly improved its manufacturing process to a level that will meet Apple's demand. Micron-Elpida and Hynix were identified in iFixit teardown analyses as the RAM suppliers for Apple's current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models.

Apple's next-generation iPhone also is rumored to sport the same design as the iPhone 6 with internal improvements such as an A9 processor and a dual-lens DSLR quality camera. Today's report also hints at the adoption of ""Force Touch"" technology as seen on the Apple Watch to differentiate between quick taps and more forceful presses.

It is not clear, however, how Apple would implement such a system on the iPhone as it would appear to require a major shift in display technology for the device given that the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED display paired with electrode sensors to support the Force Touch feature.",apple may boost amount internal ram use faster lpddr ram technology next generation iphone claim technews taiwan via g gor game ram module offer low power consumption significant performance increase gb lpddr ram used current generation iphone plus iphone stock according supply chain source lpddr ram module iphone supplied primarily hynix samsung micron elpida elpida reportedly behind schedule company allegedly improved manufacturing process level meet apple demand micron elpida hynix identified ifixit teardown analysis ram supplier apple current iphone plus model apple next generation iphone also rumored sport design iphone internal improvement processor dual lens dslr quality camera today report also hint adoption force touch technology seen apple watch differentiate quick tap forceful press clear however apple would implement system iphone would appear require major shift display technology device given apple watch us flexible oled display paired electrode sensor support force touch feature,apple allegedly improved manufacturing process level meet apple demand samsung micron elpida elpida reportedly behind schedule company allegedly improved manufacturing process level meet apple demand micron elpida hynix identified ifixit teardown analysis ram supplier apple current iphone plus model apple next generation iphone also hint adoption force touch technology seen apple watch differentiate quick tap forceful press clear however apple would implement system iphone would appear require major shift display technology device given apple watch us flexible oled display

496,"Citigroup analyst Jim Suva weighed in with his expectations for Apple Watch pricing following the news that Apple is hosting a media event on March 9. Apple already announced pricing will start at US$349—presumably for the Apple Watch Sport—and he thinks Apple Watch will cost $550 while the Apple Watch Edition will be priced at $950. He's also pegging April 16 as the smartwatch's official release date.

Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000

On Apple's March 9 media event he said,

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months.
Setting Apple Watch Sport at $350 and the standard Apple Watch at $550 falls in line with the general consensus, but the $950 price point he's targeting for Apple Watch Edition comes in well below expectations. Apple Watch Edition ships with a gold body instead of aluminium or stainless steel, and is generally expected to start somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000.

Mr. Suva said he expects Apple will offer a wide variety of accessories for Apple watch with bands starting at $29 and topping out in the hundreds of dollars. He also thinks hundreds of apps will be available on launch day.

He offered up his thoughts on which features we'll see in Apple Watch when it launches saying, ""We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use).""

Shoppers hoping to be the first to get an Apple Watch will be able to buy theirs in Apple's own retail stores and through the company's online store. Mr. Suva expects Apple's smartwatch won't be available through other retailers.

Apple sent out media invitations on Thursday for a March 9 event teased as ""Spring forward,"" which is a play on the Day Light Saving change happening on March 8, and likely a thinly veiled hint that we'll be getting more Apple Watch news.

When Apple first showed off its smartwatch last September, we saw three models with a wide selection of bands, support for tracking basic fitness activity such as steps and distance walked, along with heart rate logging. Apple Watch will also offer Apple Pay support, and will require an iPhone to perform many of its tasks.

Mr. Suva has a ""Buy"" rating on Apple's stock along with a $135 target price. Apple is currently trading at $129.59, down 0.82 (0.63%).

507,"HELL hath no fury like a woman scorned.

A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband’s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on — and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.

Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife’s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.

The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng — who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm — came across the saucy exchange and snapped.

The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.

Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.

But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.

A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesman said. “He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung’s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.

The woman Lung was cheating with — Zhang Hung, 21 — said she’s OK with her man not being able to have more children.

“It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility,” she told CEN. “He has five children already.”",hell hath fury like woman scorned jealous wife china chopped cheating husband penis slept snuck hospital room sewn back hacked tossed window fan lung dad five sealed fate decided use wife cellphone send secret lover hot heavy email central european news report year old forgot log account message sent year old wife feng arrest grievous bodily harm came across saucy exchange snapped jilted wife went berserk grabbed pair scissors stormed bedroom cut penis sleeping lung rushed hospital doctor able save appendage sew back feng able sneak recovery room chopped penis second time threw window according cen shocked lung chased wife outside despite losing lot blood staff rushed see happening found patient blood streaming leg hitting woman hospital spokesman said stopped woman taken treatment discovered chopped penis despite desperate search effort authority unable find lung manhood police believe may stumbled upon stray dog cat according cen woman lung cheating zhang hung said ok man able child matter lost fertility told cen five child already,hath fury like woman scorned jealous wife china chopped cheating husband penis slept snuck hospital room sewn back hacked tossed window fan lung dad five sealed fate decided use wife cellphone send secret lover hot heavy email central european news report year old forgot log account message sent year old wife feng arrest grievous bodily harm came across saucy exchange snapped jilted wife went berserk grabbed pair scissors stormed bedroom cut penis sleeping lung rushed hospital
517,"Three Afghanistan national army officers taken into custody after going missing during a training exercise

Three Afghan national army soldiers who did not return to a training exercise at US military base in Massachusetts were found trying to cross the Canadian border, local media reported on Monday.

The men were taken into custody at a border crossing near Niagara Falls, New York, WCVB-TV reported, citing an unidentified law enforcement source.

Military officials did not immediately respond to request for comment and the report could not be independently verified.

The three soldiers were reported missing from Joint Base Cape Cod, located in a beach resort area, after a Saturday trip to a nearby mall and are not viewed as a security threat, according to a spokesman for the Massachusetts national guard, which helps run the facility.

519,"Saudia Airlines – Saudi Arabia's national airline – is planning on segregating passengers after receiving complaints from customers over the free mixing of men and women.

According to the Emirates 247 news website, the new rules would be enforced by airline staff, preventing any one but close relatives sitting next to the opposite gender.

Abdul Rahman al-Fahd, assistant manager at Saudia Airlines, briefly commented: ""There are solutions to this problem. We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The new rules follow Saudia Airline's strong flight code of not offering any alcoholic beverages or pork dishes to customers flying with the airline.

Saudia Airlines chooses not to employ Saudi women as members of the cabin crew, although female flight desks are operating in their offices in the Murooj district in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

Other Islamic observations are maintained by the airline: most notably a verse of the Quran is read out as prayer prior to take-off. Designated prayer areas for men are also often available on many of its flights.

Many of the airlines run by the Gulf countries abide by Islamic laws, although some country airlines are more lenient than others. For instance, the female airline crew of Etihad, the Emirati airline, do not wear a veil as part of their uniform.

525,"The hackers behind a devastating cyberattack at Sony Pictures have sent a new message to executives at the company, crediting them for a ""very wise"" decision to cancel the Christmas day release of ""The Interview,"" a source close to the company told CNN.
The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN.

The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way.
A Sony spokesman declined to comment.
The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.""
The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.""
It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.""
The email was titled ""Message from GOP."" The anonymous hackers have called themselves ""Guardians of Peace.""
Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems, and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
U.S. officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack, lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a ""terrorist act"" weeks ago.
Since the cancellation on Wednesday, the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop.
Thursday night's message implied that the leaks will stop.
In a statement on Wednesday when the film's release was scrapped, the company said ""we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.""",hacker behind devastating cyberattack sony picture sent new message executive company crediting wise decision cancel christmas day release interview source close company told cnn email message received sony top executive thursday night obtained cnn source said company belief email hacker followed pattern previous message sent list particular executive formatted particular way sony spokesman declined comment hacker message effectively victory lap telling studio want never let movie released distributed leaked form instance dvd piracy message also say want everything related movie including trailer well full version website hosting immediately warns studio executive still private sensitive data claim ensure security data unless make additional trouble email titled message gop anonymous hacker called guardian peace sony still reeling late november cyberattack crippled computer system severe scrutiny canceling christmas release interview seth rogen james franco comedy attempted assassination north korean leader kim jong un u official believe north korea instigated hack lending credence sony executive privately started calling terrorist act week ago since cancellation wednesday executive wondering whether leak private email corporate document would stop thursday night message implied leak stop statement wednesday film release scrapped company said stand filmmaker right free expression extremely disappointed outcome,hacker behind devastating cyberattack sony picture sent new message executive company crediting wise decision cancel christmas day release interview source close company said company belief email hacker followed pattern previous message sent list particular executive formatted particular way sony spokesman declined comment hacker message effectively victory lap telling studio want never let movie released distributed leaked form instance dvd piracy message also say want everything related movie including trailer well full version website hosting immediately warns studio executive still private sensitive data claim ensure security data unless make additional trouble email titled message gop anonymous
528,"Shocking new details have emerged surrounding Joan Rivers' clinic visit which led to her ultimately fatal hospitalization. According to CNN, a source close to death investigators revealed that the late comedienne went into cardiac arrest while her personal doctor was performing a biopsy on her vocal chords without her consent on Aug. 28.

CNN reports that a staff member at New York City's Yorkville Endoscopy told investigators the doctor also took a selfie in the procedure room with Rivers while she was under anesthesia.

Rivers, who passed away a week following her emergency hospitalization on Sept. 4, was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy performed by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. After Cohen assessed the Fashion Police host's throat to help diagnose her hoarse voice, Rivers' personal doctor, who according to CNN's source is not a throat specialist or certified to perform biopsies at the clinic, then performed a biopsy on her vocal chords without her consent.

Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off her oxygen flow and leading to cardiac arrest.
Last week, Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic. In the statement, the clinic didn't mention Rivers' name due to confidentiality rules. A day after the denial was issued, the clinic also stated that Dr. Cohen had resigned from his position as medical director.",shocking new detail emerged surrounding joan river clinic visit led ultimately fatal hospitalization according cnn source close death investigator revealed late comedienne went cardiac arrest personal doctor performing biopsy vocal chord without consent aug photo joan river remembered cnn report staff member new york city yorkville endoscopy told investigator doctor also took selfie procedure room river anesthesia photo celebs lost year river passed away week following emergency hospitalization sept clinic routine endoscopy performed gastroenterologist dr lawrence cohen cohen assessed fashion police host throat help diagnose hoarse voice river personal doctor according cnn source throat specialist certified perform biopsy clinic performed biopsy vocal chord without consent photo joan river life career investigator believe river vocal chord began swell biopsy cutting oxygen flow leading cardiac arrest last week yorkville endoscopy issued statement denying report vocal cord biopsy ever done clinic statement clinic mention river name due confidentiality rule day denial issued clinic also stated dr cohen resigned position medical director,shocking new detail emerged surrounding joan river clinic visit led ultimately fatal hospitalization according to cnn source close death investigator revealed late comedienne went cardiac arrest personal doctor performing biopsy vocal chord without consent photo joan river remembered cnn report staff member new york city yorkville endoscopy told investigator doctor also took selfie procedure room river anesthesia photo celebs lost year river passed away week following emergency hospitalization sept clinic routine endoscopy performed gastroenterologist dr lawrence cohen cohen co
535,"Mittens is a seemingly regular household cat that enjoys being scratched under the chin and chasing string around, but there's one thing about a Newfoundland family's pet that sets it apart – Mittens is a hermaphrodite.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy, who lives in Heart's Desire, says her daughter brought Mittens home thinking it was a sick stray that had been abandoned by its owner.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy, of Heart's Desire, N.L., says she was shocked when her veterinarian told her the cat who followed her daughter home had both male and female genitalia. (CBC)

She took the cat to a local veterinarian, and after an examination in October got the news that makes Mittens unique.

The cat has both male and female genitalia.

Clarke-Murphy said it was the last thing she expected to hear about the newest addition to her family.

Her first response to the vet's news was, ""Did I just hear you right?""

Clarke-Murphy said she would prefer to have another female cat — she already has a male and female cat — but she'll follow the advice of her vet, who recommends Mittens be assigned a male gender.

""They're the ones who know what they're doing. I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts,"" said Clarke-Murphy.

""I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.""

The vet told Clarke-Murphy the cat would need to be both spayed and neutered, and then have reconstructive surgery once a gender is assigned.

Vet bill will be about $1,500

While the vet bills are estimated to come in around $1,500 for all of the cat's surgeries, Clarke-Murphy said it will be worth it to ensure Mittens is in good health.

""She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter,"" she said.

Currently, Mittens has bowel issues and problems urinating as a result of its dual gender.

Clarke-Murphy said a friend is conducting an auction of used items on Facebook to help pay for the family's vet bills

""She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter.""

Strays a problem for area

Denise Sooley-Critch, an area volunteer who works on her own to help find homes for strays, said there's a big problem with stray animals in the region.

Denise Sooley-Critch mittens hermaphrodite cat strays
Denise Sooley-Critch says there is a problem with stray cats in the Heart's Desire region, but animals like Mittens show the value of the kind of pet a stray can be. (CBC)

She said the cost of spaying and neutering tends to be the factor that drives people to abandon their cat. That, paired with the misconception the SPCA would euthanize the animal, leads people to leave the pets outside in the wild.

""They think by dumping the cats it's actually saving the cat's life, but it's a horrible death out there, starving and freezing,"" said Sooley-Critch.

However, Sooley-Critch said she's never heard a story anything like Mittens' tale, adding that the situation has her ""blown away""

548,"What did you do this weekend? Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adopted a young boy as her godson so he wouldn't turn into a werewolf and eat babies. Yes, really! (Kind of.)

It's actually part of a long-standing tradition stemming from Argentinian folklore that says the seventh son in families with no girls are doomed to turn into ""el lobison,"" a werewolf who feeds on unbaptized babies and whose bites could turn others into werewolves. Belief in the legend was once reportedly so widespread that families were abandoning their seventh sons, giving them up for adoption, or killing them.

A law was passed in the 1920s to counteract the effect (the law was expanded in 2009 to include girls and non-Catholic children), and now, every year, the president formally adopts a boy or girl as his or her godchild, awarding him or her a medal, ""presidential protection,"" and a scholarship to study until the godchild turns 21.

This year, Fernandez de Kirchner formally adopted Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. In 1993, Yair's parents reportedly wrote to the president asking for the honor and were denied, but this year, Yair wrote to Fernandez de Kirchner himself and got his wish, making him the first Jewish boy in Argentina to be officially adopted by the president.

549,"Hugh Hefner was presumed to be dead of natural causes, Sunday, December 28, 2014. Well, that’s the story which was given from a fake sub-medium of NBC called NBCToday.co. This site can’t be called news satire because once “nbctoday.co” is entered as the URL address, it takes the user straight to the fake story.

Though the story is fake, it spread like wildfire, seemingly without anyone bothering to research the issue himself or herself.

As of 11 p.m. PST, the Hugh Hefner fake-death story had over 159,000 Facebook shares, along with over 39,000 Likes. Likewise, it has approximately 1800 Twitter shares. Unfortunately, by sunrise, this fake Hugh Hefner story may be trending.

The story states that police responded to Hugh Hefner’s estate on December 28 at approximately 9 a.m., where Hefner’s body was identified, and he was pronounced dead.

However, as can be seen from his wife Crystal Hefner”s Twitter update, Hugh is alive and enjoying his time with family.

Fortunately, the entire story is fabricated. The only other possibility is that he died and was revived. However, there is nothing on Crystal Hefner’s social media that indicates any kind of scare of such magnitude.

However, she does offer a witty quote regarding the Hugh Hefner death story.

A lie can run around the world before the truth has got it’s boots on. #QuoteOfTheDay

— Crystal Hefner (@crystalhefner) December 29, 2014

This statement, along with the “family night” photo, was made only a few hours ago. Whereas, Hugh Hefner was supposed to have been dead around 9 a.m. And unless Hugh has someone managing his social media profiles, he made his own tweets shortly before his wife.

Tonight’s Mansion movie is “American Sniper.”

— Hugh Hefner (@hughhefner) December 29, 2014

He also retweeted what his wife tweeted afterwards. So sensibly, had Hugh Hefner passed, there would be a buzzing frenzy coming from the Playmates, let alone the rest of the media world.

It would benefit many to perform a little research before taking things as they come.

@crystalhefner Dear Crystal Sorry for your loss, may God bless you and your family!

And that comment was after Crystal stated that the story wasn’t true.

556,"BREAKING: INFORMANT? Paris Terror Suspect on US Watch List Met With French President Sarkozy in 2009

21st Century Wire says…

As the dust settles from this week’s terror extravaganza in France, more loose ends are turning up (or being tied up), with this latest bizarre bombshell which is already fueling speculation as to the covert nature of the Charlie Hebdo false flag affair.

A police commissioner from Limoges, France, Helric Fredou, aged 45 (photo, below), turned up dead from a gun shot to the head on Thursday amid the Charlie Hebdo affair. A high-ranking official within the French law enforcement command-and-control structure, Fredou was also a former deputy director of the regional police service.


At the time of his death, police claim to have not known the reason for his alleged suicide. This was reflected in their official statements to the media: “It is unknown at this time the reasons for his actions”. However, a back story appears to have been inserted simultaneously, most likely from the very same police media liaisons, who then told the press that Fredou was ‘depressed and overworked’. For any law enforcement officer in France, it would seem rather odd that anyone would want to miss the biggest single terror event in the century, or history in the making, as it were.

Here is a link to the original report in the French media, which confirms that Commissioner Fredou was indeed working on the Charlie Hebdo case:

“The Fredou Commissioner, like all agents SRPJ, worked yesterday on the case of the massacre at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo. In particular, he was investigating the family of one of the victims. He killed himself before completing its report. A psychological ‘cell’ was set up in the police station.”

Helric-Fredou-3
EDITOR’S NOTE: It is not yet known to 21WIRE exactly how the fatal gun shot occurred, but if any other past political and high-profile ‘suicided’ cases are anything to go by, authorities will claim that this victim either shot himself in the back of the head,  with his non-shooting hand. In addition, if that were the case, there would also be a lack of gun powder burns on the hands according to the autopsy.

UK-based investigative reporter Morris108, interviews ‘Phil in France’ regarding this new development:




Even more bizarrely, an almost identical event took place just over one year earlier, November 2013 in Limoges, when the number 3 ranked SRPJ officer had killed himself in similar circumstances, with his weapon in the police hotel. Allegedly, his colleague discovered his body. The prosecution ruled that case was a suicide too, and the police officer had left a suicide note to his family in which he expressed “personal reasons” for his surprising action.

Stay tuned for more updates on this story at 21WIRE.

Police commissioner, who had been investigating the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine committed suicide with his service gun on Thursday night.

Police commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack on the French weekly satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, committed suicide in his office. The incident occurred in Limoges, the administrative capital of the Limousin region in west-central France, on Thursday night, local media France 3 reports.
Helric Fredou, 45, suffered from ‘depression’ and experienced ‘burn out’ [according to the official statement]. Shortly before committing suicide, he met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack and killed himself preparing the report.

Fredou began his career in 1997 as a police officer at the regional office of the judicial police of Versailles. Later he returned to Limoges, his hometown. Since 2012 he had been the deputy director of the regional police service.
“We are all shocked. Nobody was ready for such developments”, a representative of the local police union told reporters.
On January 7, 2015, two gunmen burst into the editorial office of Charlie Hebdo magazine, known for issuing cartoons, ridiculing Islam.

558,"ISIS is trying to sell the remains of beheaded journalist James Foley to his parents or the US government for $1 million, according to a new report.

A source who is a middleman contacted by ISIS to broker the deal told BuzzFeed that the terror group is trying to present it as an act of mercy for the family and a “humanity case,” the Web site said.

The Islamic fundamentalist group, which has overrun large sections of Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of people in the process, had been financing its military by selling oil produced by the wells in the areas it has captured and by collecting ransom from the governments of its non-American hostages.

But with the price of crude oil now plummeting and the United States and Britain standing firmly by their policy to not pay ransoms, ISIS — also known as the Islamic State — devised the plan to sell the corpse.

ISIS beheaded Foley on video last August.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” the source told Buzzfeed. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

The source told the Web site that he is concerned the United States will stop the deal even if the family wants it, because the government nixed a ransom demand before Foley’s death.",isi trying sell remains beheaded journalist james foley parent u government million according new report source middleman contacted isi broker deal told buzzfeed terror group trying present act mercy family humanity case web site said islamic fundamentalist group overrun large section iraq syria killing thousand people process financing military selling oil produced well area captured collecting ransom government non american hostage price crude oil plummeting united state britain standing firmly policy pay ransom isi also known islamic state devised plan sell corpse isi beheaded foley video last august photojournalist james foley talk reporter associated press boston photo apit offering family dna sample prove body holding really ask million send dna turkey want money first source told buzzfeed give dna without money source told web site concerned united state stop deal even family want government nixed ransom demand foley death,isi trying sell remains beheaded journalist james foley parent u government million according new report source middleman contacted isi broker deal told buzzfeed terror group trying present act mercy family humanity case web site said islamic fundamentalist group overrun large section iraq syria killing thousand people process financing military selling oil produced well area captured collecting ransom government non american hostage price crude oil plummeting united state britain standing firmly policy pay ransom isi also known islam
561,"Tampa, Fla. (CBS TAMPA) – A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself “Jasmine Tridevil” says she spent $20,000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest.
The Florida woman told a Florida radio station that she “called like 50 or 60 doctors” in order to have the surgery adding a third breast. The 21-year-old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it’s not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery – it was also a desire to rebuff men
“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she told Real Radio. “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore… Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”
“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”
Last month, she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radiohead’s “Creep” plays in the background.
Her “Jasmine Tridevil” social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief – and support — at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself.
Tridevil received the surgery a few months prior, although “it was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.
Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

563,"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 5.1 percent at $37 in premarket trading on Monday.

Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.

The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue the fiscal year ending October.

""Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,"" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.

Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which had a market value of about $66 billion as of Friday.

Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

Online auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

WHITMAN TO LEAD ENTERPRISE

HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.

HP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.

Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals such as Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments.

Dell Inc, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.

HP's PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines.

HP on Monday affirmed its fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.70 to $3.74 per share. It also forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of $3.83-$4.03 per share, in line with the average analyst estimate of $3.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

HP's announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

Up to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year. (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore, David Henry in New York, Edwin Chan in San Francisco and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Savio D'Souza)

566,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Houthi rebels took all U.S. Embassy vehicles parked at the Yemeni capital's airport and wouldn't let departing U.S. Marines take their weapons with them, a top Sanaa airport official said about the latest evidence of unrest in an Arab nation long seen as key in America's fight against terrorists.

The actions come after the United States, along with Britain, suspended operations at their embassies and moved out staffers because of the instability in Yemen.

According to the official, the Houthis seized many U.S. Marines' weapons at the airport, and the American troops also handed over some to random airport officials.

However, a senior U.S. military official told CNN the Marines disabled their weapons and gave them to a Yemeni security detail, which had escorted them to the airport, because the Marines were flying commercial.

The U.S. Marine Corps sharply denied the allegations.

""All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan,"" the statement read.

The statement continued: ""To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.""

The previous night, embassy officials burned tens of thousands of documents and destroyed weapons that were inside the Sanaa embassy's storage warehouses, Yemeni employees of the embassy said.

What you need to know about Yemen

Yemen has been an important country to the United States as the home of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most feared, influential and operational terrorist organizations in the world. U.S. officials have had a long relationship with Yemeni leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants.

But now, Yemen's latest leader, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, is gone, having resigned after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed him under house arrest.

All this movement has left the Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- as the pre-eminent power in Yemen.

Their takeover hasn't been smooth and it's not clear whether it will ever be complete. There has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.

Then there's the question of what it means for the United States and its anti-terrorism efforts.

U.S. special forces stay in Yemen

As of last month, U.S. officials hadn't engaged in talks with the Houthis, though there were discussions about whether to talk to them.

Still, even amid the turmoil, the U.S. military remains active in Yemen.

Take, for instance, the killing of senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle on January 31.

""They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, and frankly ... there's some counterterrorism training that's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

""I'd be less than honest if I said that there hadn't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty,"" he said. ""We're just going to have to watch this closely going forward.""

Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against AQAP, which has been tied to the failed attempt by ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab and Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan. More recently, the terror group has been linked to the slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo.

""They are a very dangerous group,"" said Kirby. ""They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests, and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America. We're watching them very closely.""

576,"Despite being heavy competitors with each other, Samsung and Apple do quite a bit more business with each other than some might realize, Samsung has long been a supplier of some Apple product components for iPhones and iPads, and back in January they were rumored to be providing Apple the S1 system-in-package chipset for the Apple watch that debuts later this year. Now there are reports stating that through their Samsung Display arm they may become a future supplier to Apple for displays of the Apple watch. The report also states that LG Display will actually be the first provider of the OLED displays that the Apple watch is said to be using. LG Display also currently makes displays for the iPad.

As we stated above this wouldn’t be the first time that we’ve seen Apple work alongside its competitors, let alone two of its biggest competitors, to bring one of its own devices to market. Apple of course, had to get the Apple watch displays from somewhere because they don’t make their own displays for their products, and seeing as how both Samsung and LG have already produced more than one smartwatch themselves along with the displays on them, should these rumors be true it actually makes a lot of sense. Currently the Apple Watch isn’t available, but it is reportedly going on sale this year in April, and for the time being the rumor states that LG will be the sole supplier at first.

What’s more, is that Samsung is reported to be joining in on the display sales sometime as early as the second half of 2015 or very early 2016 potentially for the next version of the Apple watch, although at this point in time Samsung and LG have both declined to comment on these rumors stated in the South Korean media. Apple has kept quiet on the matter as well. Whether or not there is any truth to these rumors seems to be uncertain for now, but knowing that Apple buys display tech from LG Display already, the rumors are reasonable enough to be at least plausible and it’s certainly possible for LG Display to make more screens for other Apple products.",despite heavy competitor samsung apple quite bit business might realize samsung long supplier apple product component iphones ipads back january rumored providing apple system package chipset apple watch debut later year report stating samsung display arm may become future supplier apple display apple watch report also state lg display actually first provider oled display apple watch said using lg display also currently make display ipad stated first time seen apple work alongside competitor let alone two biggest competitor bring one device market apple course get apple watch display somewhere make display product seeing samsung lg already produced one smartwatch along display rumor true actually make lot sense currently apple watch available reportedly going sale year april time rumor state lg sole supplier first samsung reported joining display sale sometime early second half early potentially next version apple watch although point time samsung lg declined comment rumor stated south korean medium apple kept quiet matter well whether truth rumor seems uncertain knowing apple buy display tech lg display already rumor reasonable enough least plausible certainly possible lg display make screen apple product,rumor true actually make lot sense currently apple watch available going sale year april time rumor state lg sole supplier first samsung reported joining display sale sometime early second half early potentially next version apple watch rumor true actually make lot sense currently apple watch available reportedly going sale year april time rumor state lg sole supplier first samsung reported joining display sale sometime early second half early potentially next version apple watch rumor reasonable enough least plausible certainly possible lg
579,"The 80-year-old and bride-to-be Afton Elaine Burton were granted permission late last year to get hitched - but it hasn't gone ahead

VIEW GALLERY

Charles Manson was being married for money not love after his fiancee only wanted the wedding so she could cash in on his corpse, it has been claimed.

A new book alleges the serial killer's engagement to Afton Elaine Burton was part of a crazy scheme of hers to make money by putting his body on public display after his death.

According to journalist Daniel Simone, the 27-year-old sought to wed the mastermind of the Helter Skelter murders so she could gain possession of his remains when he died.

Simone claims Burton, known as Star, and her friend, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Manson’s remains in a glass crypt.

The pair began concocting their ghoulish plot over two years ago believing their bizarre tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money.

Marriage Off: Charles Manson has refused to marry Afton Burton despite being granted a marriage license

However Manson, 80, who recently refused to marry Burton after the pair were granted a marriage licence, is alleged to have discover the plot and wanted not further part.

“He’s finally realised that he’s been played for a fool,” Simone said.

Initially, Burton and Hammond had asked the killer to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies.

“He didn’t give them a yes, he didn’t give them a no. He sort of strung them along,” Simone claimed.

They tried to ingratiate themselves with the killer buying him toiletries and other items however he was wise to their plans and kept stringing them along.

When they finally realised he wouldn't grant them consent to have his body it was then, Simone alleges, they thought of the marriage plan.

Under Californian law a wife would be given possession of her husband’s remains upon his death. Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton.

“Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,” he said.

Enterprise News and Pictures   Bizarre Claim: A journalist has alleged that Burton wanted to put Manson on display in a glass coffin

The journalist also said Manson feels “it is a stupid idea” as he thinks he is immortal. “He feels he will never die,” Simone added.

But despite the author’s claims Burton says she hopes to be granted a second marriage licence.

Writing on her website she said: “They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months.”

The 80-year-old and Burton applied late last year to get hitched.

However US prison officials confirmed no ceremony has taken place the before last Thursday’s deadline.

The weekend before was the last occasion the couple could have married inside a visiting room at California State Prison, Corcoran.

On her website Burton said the nuptials, Manson’s third, was postponed “due to an unexpected interruption in logistics.”

She said Manson had been receiving treatment for the last two months in the prison’s hospital wing and could not receive any visitors.

Simone along with Heidi Jordan Ley, have been working on their book “The Retrial of Charles Manson” with the help of the killer and other inmates.

They were in regular contact with the former cult leader before his phone privileges were suspended but now correspond with him through letters.

Manson is serving a life sentence for his role in the murders of seven people including actress Sharon Tate and one unborn child in Los Angeles in 1969.

As a life prisoner with no parole date set, Manson is not entitled to conjugal visits. He is not eligible to apply for parole again until 2027.

Burton first met Manson after months of writing. She then left her family home with £1,200 in savings to move closer to Manson in California.

She now visits him every Saturday and Sunday for up to five hours a day.

The ENT, who wasn’t authorized to perform any medical procedures at the clinic took over and began a biopsy.

The biopsy was not authorized, as Rivers never signed a consent form. And once it began, her vocal cords began to swell, Anderson 360 revealed Tuesday night. But that’s not all. Not only was the ENT not supposed to be treating the comedienne, 81, at this time, medical staffers have also told investigators that the ENT snapped a selfie with the Fashion Police star while she was under anesthesia – a major violation of privacy, given she did not give her consent to have her picture taken.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

590,"Over the years, countless food items have come and gone from McDonald’s finely-tuned menu, but one franchise owner in the Midwest decided that the McPizza was more than just a fad. That’s right — the McDonald’s pizza that you knew (and loved?) in the ’90s is still on the menu, but only at two U.S. locations.


FROM EARLIER: Video: McDonald’s explains that its McNuggets are really made from chicken and contain no beaks

As reported by Canada.com, one McDonald’s on the Ohio River and another in Spencer, West Virginia, both owned by Greg Mills, still serve piping hot McPizzas day in and day out.

“According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s,” writes Canada.com’s Ashley Csanady.

Norman tells Canada.com that there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

So if you were planning on making a cross-country road trip any time soon, it might be worth altering your route just to make sure you pass through Spencer, West Virginia on your way.

594,"The video showing the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven J. Sotloff appears to be authentic, U.S. officials said Wednesday as President Obama said America would not be “intimidated” by Islamic State militants.

“The U.S. intelligence community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

Sotloff’s family, through a spokesman, issued a statement suggesting they believed the footage to be authentic as well. “The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately,” said the spokesman, Barak Barfi.

It was the second such killing carried out by Islamic State militants. Late last month, American journalist James Foley was beheaded in a similar videotaped slaying.

In Estonia, Obama vowed to “destroy” the Islamic State militants and said the United States would “not be intimidated” by the bloodshed.

The Sotloff video, which surfaced online Tuesday, shows a bound and kneeling Sotloff being held at knife-point by a black-clad militant against a desert backdrop similar to the one shown in an earlier video depicting the beheading of Foley.

The gruesome killings and the group’s threat to decapitate other captives put new pressure on the Obama administration at a time when it is weighing how the United States should respond to an al-Qaeda offshoot that is seen as ruthless but that has not carried out plots beyond the region.

The United States has carried out more than 100 airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq over the past month since the group expanded its control of territory there. But the administration has avoided direct U.S. military involvement in Syria aside from a failed attempt to rescue Foley and other captives earlier this year.

The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have developed lists of possible Islamic State targets in Syria. But Obama, who has expressed concerns about being drawn into Syria’s civil war, indicated last week that he had not yet approved new strikes. “We don’t have a strategy yet,” Obama said in a remark that was later derided by Republican lawmakers and critics.

U.S. officials believe that as many as a dozen Americans may be fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and that the group holds at least two other American hostages, both aid workers.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, had written for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and other publications. He was believed to have been taken captive shortly after entering Syria in 2013, and he was shown in the video of Foley that the Islamic State released last month. Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, recently  released a video pleading with the group for her son’s release.

In the video, an unidentified militant denounces the Obama administration, saying, “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.” He cites recent U.S. airstrikes against the group in Iraq and warns that “just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

The militant speaks with a British accent, raising the possibility that he is the same person who killed Foley, 40. Both hostages wore orange jumpsuits, much like prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Foley and Sotloff may not have been killed at the same time or place. The militant in the Sotloff video appears to refer to U.S. airstrikes at Amerli in Iraq, which began over the weekend. Sotloff also appears to have more hair on his head and face than in the first video.

The latest video, obtained by the Site Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks the online postings of Islamist militant groups, also shows another hostage identified as David Cawthorne Haines. Haines is a British aid worker who was abducted in March 2013 near the Atmeh refu­gee camp adjoining the Turkish border and the Syrian province of Idlib, according to aid workers involved in efforts to secure his release.

In an apparent reference to Britain, Sotloff’s killer warns “governments that enter this evil alliance of America . . . to back off and leave our people alone.” Haines is shown in the same kneeling position and wearing the same type of orange jumpsuit as Sotloff and Foley before him.

Sotloff had traveled into and out of Syria several times before he was abducted after entering the country from Turkey on Aug. 4, 2013, according to a person familiar with the details of his case. The Florida native had covered turmoil in countries including Egypt and Libya, where his reporting served as the basis of a Time magazine reconstruction of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on U.S. compounds in Benghazi.

In the video that surfaced Tuesday, Sotloff stares stone-faced into the camera while delivering a statement apparently scripted by his captors. “I am Steven Joel Sotloff,” he says, adding that he is “paying the price” for the Obama administration’s policies in the Middle East.

The video lasts less than three minutes but appears to have been carefully produced by the terrorist group, which has used online propaganda to position itself as a successor to al-Qaeda and declare itself the leader of a new Islamic caliphate.

The recording opens with footage of Obama’s remarks after Foley’s death, then cuts to video of Sotloff taken from two camera angles. A digital representation of the Islamic State’s black banner flutters in the upper left corner of the frame.

Foley’s killing last month prompted an unusually emotional response from Obama, who interrupted his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard to warn that the United States would be “relentless” against the Islamic State. Obama, who departed Tuesday for a trip to Estonia and Wales, did not publicly respond to Sotloff’s apparent killing.

British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a statement saying that the video, if authentic, depicts “a despicable and barbaric murder” and that the Islamic State fighters “threaten Syrians, Iraqis, Americans and British people alike and make no distinction between Muslims, Christians or any other faith.”

Haines is among several Western hostages believed to be held by the Islamic State, possibly in Raqqah, a Syrian city that serves as the group’s stronghold.

U.S. and British authorities are still seeking to determine the identity of Foley’s killer. His British accent has intensified concerns in Britain and elsewhere in Europe about the large number of European citizens who have flocked to Syria’s civil war over the past four years.

Britain, France and other countries have seen hundreds of citizens depart for Syria, almost all of them carrying passports that would allow them to return to their home countries or travel to other Western nations.

British officials raised the country’s threat level to “severe” last week as the nation’s home secretary warned that terrorist plots were seen as “highly likely” because of the fallout from the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.

597,"LAS VEGAS (KSNV MyNews3.com) – CNBC cites sources that Tesla has chosen Nevada as the site for its battery factory plant.

No details are available on the specific location for the plant, but Gov. Brian Sandoval has scheduled a news conference for Thursday to discuss a major economic development announcement. Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal also report that Nevada has been chosen.
KSNV political reporter Jon Ralston reports that Sandoval is talking to state lawmakers about scheduling a special session to approve financial incentives for Tesla.

Five states have reportedly competed to house the facility: Nevada, California, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico reportedly have been in the running for the plant.

Tesla has reportedly asked the states to commit as much as $500 million in incentives, or about 10 percent of the gigafactory’s overall cost.

The $5 billion plan is set to begin production of 500,000 lithium battery packs by 2017 for use in Tesla’s Model 3 cars.

The airlines said it decided to act following recurrent complaints from passengers objecting to have males seated next to their wives and other female family members.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, quoted by the Saudi Arabic language daily ‘Ajel’.

He did not elaborate, but the paper said it would include instructions to flight booking staff at the Gulf kingdom’s airports to ensure males and females are separated aboard Saudia’s flights unless they are closely related.",saudi arabia national carrier saudia intends ban gender mixing aboard flight line rule enforced conservative gulf kingdom airline said decided act following recurrent complaint passenger objecting male seated next wife female family member solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger saudia assistant manager marketing abdul rahman al fahd said quoted saudi arabic language daily ajel elaborate paper said would include instruction flight booking staff gulf kingdom airport ensure male female separated aboard saudia flight unless closely related,airline said decided act following recurrent complaint passenger objecting male seated next wife female family member solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger saudi arabia national carrier saudi arabia national carrier saudi arabia national carrier saudi arabia national carrier saudi arabia national carrier saudi arabia national carrier saudi arabia national carrier saudia intends ban gender mixing aboard flight line rule enforced conservative gulf kingdom airline said decided act following recurrent complaint passenger objecting male seated next
605,"An airliner in Saudi Arabia has a new in-flight plan for its passengers that involves segregation. The country’s national airline is introducing new seating assignments that will be based on gender separation. The commercial flight service, in keeping with Saudi Islamic law, is responding to complaints from passengers about males sitting next to their wives, according to a Daily Mail news report.

Saudi Arabia’s national airline fielded a string of complaints from a number of male fliers who are protesting other males sitting next to their spouses and other female relatives. Accordingly, the airline met over creating rules for passengers in order to remain in strict compliance with laws that govern Islam in the Gulf kingdom.

Women soon to be segregated aboard Saudi planes.

Future plans are to institute segregation rules aboard Saudi Arabia Airlines flights. In short, males and females will not be allowed to sit adjacent to one another unless they are closes relatives. The concern is that the rules will clash with passengers who represent other nationalities and do not practice Islamic laws. Saudi assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd weighed in on the subject.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

Although the new plans for separating men and women aboard flights is part of a new initiative, most Saudi Arabia customs are already practiced aboard commercial airlines in the region. Several examples; pork dishes and alcohol, which are served aboard passenger planes in the West and other nation states, are forbidden on Middle Eastern and Sharia observant flights. Additionally, a verse from the Qur’an is read with accompanying an prayer before every flight, and international flights offer an on-board prayer room for men only.

Although the country does not allow Saudi women to work as cabin crew members, they employ the services of women from other countries. Moreover, Saudi Arabia Airlines’ segregation extends to the ground. In November, the company opened its fourth all-women office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh, wrote DM.

Some say the move to segregate women and men aboard Saudi airliners violates United Nations laws on human rights. Nonetheless, practitioners of Islamic law point to custom and religion, saying it’s not used to oppress women.

Still, many others say it’s pure gender inequality and has no place in the modern world. It’s known that women in Gulf states are required to enter and exit using special doors in public spaces. Months ago, Inquistir reported that women with “pretty eyes” are being forced to cover them up to prevent temptation.

Additionally, women are forbidden to socialize with another male unless he is a close relative. If she does, charges can include prostitution, fornication and adultery. The penalties are harsh and can include stoning and death. The new Saudi Arabian airline segregation policy will undoubtedly fan the flames in the ongoing debate between what many view as oppressive religious laws and human rights.

606,"TORPOINT — No one likes getting bills, but one bill in particular has a family in Torpoint completely shocked.

According to the Plymouth Herald, it all happened after 5-year-old Alex Nash was invited to a friend’s birthday party at a ski and snowboarding facility.

After Alex was invited to the bash, Nash’s parents told his friend’s mother he would attend the party. But later, they realized they already had made other plans for that day, so Alex missed the party.

Several days later, the little boy came home from school with an envelope in his book bag. It contained an invoice from his friend’s mother for a “child’s party no show fee.”

The total was about $24.

At first, they thought the bill was a joke and the woman they would not be paying the fee. But then, they say, she threatened to take them to small claims court.

They also claimed that Alex’s friend will not play with him anymore.

613,"Defence officials were unable to confirm local media reports that the Isis boss was among those hit

The US-led coalition against Isis has carried out a bomb attack on a convoy of senior militants that may have included the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

American defence officials confirmed that the air strikes on Friday night destroyed 10 armoured vehicles near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, and that the mission had been ""against what was assessed to be a gathering of [Isis] leaders"".

Iraqi state television and two officials also said yesterday that the Isis leader had been wounded.

An Interior Ministry official and a senior Iraqi military official both told the Associated Press that the strike on Saturday had wounded Baghdadi, but gave no details about how bad his injuries might be, following speculation about his death.

The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant step change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group.

Among those reportedly confirmed killed in the strikes was Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, also known as Abu Saja, one of al-Baghdadi's key aides and a man who regularly travelled with the militant group's self-proclaimed ""caliph"" or spiritual leader.

But while the Al Arabiya News Channel quoted local tribal sources as saying that al-Baghdadi was ""critically wounded"" in the attack, neither US nor Iraqi officials were able to provide further details.

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning, Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton discussed al-Baghdadi's ""potential death"", suggesting the UK is confident there is at least a strong chance the Isis leader may have been successfully targeted.

Gen Houghton said he could not ""absolutely confirm"" that al-Baghdadi was in the convoy, but warned that the terror group's leadership would ""regenerate"" regardless of his fate.

""What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse in Isis,"" he said.

The Pentagon has released a statement saying that it ""cannot confirm if [Isis] leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present"", nonetheless adding that the strikes as a whole ""demonstrate the pressure we continue to place on the IS terrorist network"".

Meanwhile on Sunday it also emerged that Iraqi military forces had reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji, a major gain in the battle for the country's biggest oil refinery located nearby.

An Iraqi army colonel said government troops entered Isis-occupied Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre.

Speaking before those gains in a CBS ""Face The Nation"" interview broadcast today, Barack Obama hailed what he called the ""very effective"" air strikes carried out by the international coalition.

""The air strikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" the US President said.

""Now what we need is ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, that can start pushing them back.""

Obama announced on Friday that he had ordered the deployment of up to 1,500 more US soldiers to support Iraqi forces, which could bring the overall contribution of American troops in the country to 3,100.",defence official unable confirm local medium report isi bos among hit u led coalition isi carried bomb attack convoy senior militant may included group leader abu bakr al baghdadi american defence official confirmed air strike friday night destroyed armoured vehicle near northern iraqi city mosul mission assessed gathering isi leader iraqi state television two official also said yesterday isi leader wounded interior ministry official senior iraqi military official told associated press strike saturday wounded baghdadi gave detail bad injury might following speculation death death elusive leader would mark significant step change u led effort curtail islamist extremist group among reportedly confirmed killed strike abdul rahman al athaee also known abu saja one al baghdadi key aide man regularly travelled militant group self proclaimed caliph spiritual leader al arabiya news channel quoted local tribal source saying al baghdadi critically wounded attack neither u iraqi official able provide detail speaking bbc andrew marr show morning chief defence staff general sir nicholas houghton discussed al baghdadi potential death suggesting uk confident least strong chance isi leader may successfully targeted gen houghton said could absolutely confirm al baghdadi convoy warned terror group leadership would regenerate regardless fate want rush sense potential death one totemic leader going create strategic reverse isi said pentagon released statement saying confirm isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi among present nonetheless adding strike whole demonstrate pressure continue place terrorist network meanwhile sunday also emerged iraqi military force reached centre northern city baiji major gain battle country biggest oil refinery located nearby iraqi army colonel said government troop entered isi occupied baiji city people south west took al tamim neighbourhood city centre speaking gain cbs face nation interview broadcast today barack obama hailed called effective air strike carried international coalition air strike effective degrading isil capability slowing advance making u president said need ground troop iraqi ground troop start pushing back obama announced friday ordered deployment u soldier support iraqi force could bring overall contribution american troop country,isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi american defence official confirmed air strike friday night destroyed armoured vehicle near northern iraqi city mosul mission assessed gathering isi leader iraqi state television two official also said yesterday isi leader wounded baghdadi gave detail bad injury might following speculation death death death elusive leader would mark significant step change u led effort curtail islamist extremist group among reportedly confirmed killed strike abdul rahman al athae
617,"Beats Music will eventually disappear as a brand, according to a new report. TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service, which it acquired in May, but doesn’t say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. Once source tells TechCrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into iTunes; another source says Apple will make a “significant music announcement” in the first half of 2015.

Engineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple, including iTunes, according to the report. As TechCrunch notes, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was put in charge of Apple’s ad-supported iTunes Radio product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then.

When Apple bought the Beats brand for $3 billion, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music “ the first music subscription service done right .” Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify, Rdio, and others, Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor. But after three months it had only 250,000 subscribers, compared to  over 10 million  on Spotify. Still, Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apple’s music strategy, saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads.
All of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away, on-demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form. If iTunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your MP3s and on-demand streaming into a single place, the Beats Music brand going away might not be such a bad thing, after all.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl,"" the girl told South African Press Association, SAPA.
Determined to teach her boyfriend a lesson, she searched in her father's tools for a wheel spanner and got hold of a battery acid.

629,"9-year-old girl has written a hearfelt letter to her teacher, after he revealed he was gay during a lesson on homophobic bullying.


It reads: “Dear Mr R
“Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the word’s (sic) that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.
“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.
“You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everone in the class feels the same way as I do.
“From A x x
PS. We are all proud of you”
The teacher told PinkNews: “As a primary school teacher I’d always worried about mentioning my sexuality, despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands, wives and significant others all the time.

“Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.
“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.
“After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I’m gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.
“The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.
“The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments.
“Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.
“For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow up, just acceptance.
“Now, I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better.

631,"Dornnella Conner lost her left eye when a police officer fired a non-lethal bean bag round at the car her boyfriend was driving on the outskirts of Ferguson, Mo. early Tuesday.

A pregnant St. Louis woman wants justice after she lost her left eye in a violent run-in with police early Tuesday at the edge of Ferguson, Mo.

Before Dornnella Conner went for a ride into the hell that engulfed St. Louis suburb on Monday night, she shared an illustration with her Facebook friends of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin walking arm-in-arm – along with her own thoughts: “RIP – feeling mad.”

Just hours later she would be part of the tragic storyline when a police officer fired a non-lethal bean bag round at the car her boyfriend was driving, shattering the passenger side window and leaving her face a bloody mess, according to reports.

“I will have justice for what they did to me,” Conner wrote on Facebook Thursday. “But I’m happy I’m alive.”

Protesters took to the streets when a St. Louis grand jury chose not to charge police officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Brown.

The couple was parked at the BP gas station on New Halls Ferry Road in St. Louis, just north of the mayhem in Ferguson, when police moved in to clear the area. Police reported gun fire from the gas station and eventually made 16 arrests, KMOV reported.

Police also claim someone tried to run down an officer, who fired at the car fearing for his safety. Turns out, Conner was struck. Doctors were unable to save her left eye and Conner reports blurry vision in the other.

“My sister can now only see one side of things – literally,” Conner’s sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, told KMOV. “I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.”

Conner said she and her beau were just bystanders caught up in an unfortunate situation.

Now she’s disabled and police have issued a warrant for her boyfriend’s arrest.

635,"Let's face it: Apple's not so good at social. Path, the former ""private"" social network with not many users sucks at social too. Now, Apple is reportedly buying Path. It all makes so much sense.

The news comes via PandoDaily, which quotes an anonymous ""single well-placed source inside Apple's engineering team"" as saying: ""It's almost done, if not signed already, but it's essentially a done deal.""

Despite claims of a growing user base in recent months, Path, with its 25 million users, still lags far behind giants like Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter. The company has been hemorrhaging employees and making desperate attempts to bounce back by releasing apps like Talk, a private messenger with bells and whistles, and a premium version with stickers and photo filters that no one really pays for.

Still, the app did gain critical acclaim for its beautiful user interface, so perhaps Apple could be its natural home. Cult of Mac points out that Path's ties to Apple go way back. Path CEO, Dave Morin, is a former employee, and during Tuesday's iPhone 6 keynote, he was spotted sitting up front, a place usually reserved for Apple executives.

According to PandoDaily, the app itself is likely to survive the acquisition by being incorporated into Apple's newly refreshed Messages app in iOS 8. How? Your guess is as good as ours.

637,"A robotic vacuum cleaner ""attacked"" a South Korean woman while she slept by attempting to suck up the hair on her head.

The woman, a 52-year-old resident of Changwon who has not been named, was awoken by the pain and, unable to extricate herself from the robot, called the fire department for help.

She was eventually freed by paramedics, escaping serious injury but losing several strands of hair.

It required two paramedics to remove her hair from the machine's nozzle, Korea Biz Wire reported.

The incident, which took place on January 3, highlighted the potential risk of this type of accident in South Korea, where sitting and sleeping on the floor is common practice.

The vacuum only stopped running more than a minute after initially ingesting the woman's hair.

She was still unable to free herself from the vacuum and made a ""desperate rescue request"" call to 119, South Korea's emergency telephone number.

Robotic vacuum cleaners are equipped with sensors allowing them to clean surfaces by detecting dirt while avoiding obstacles such as stairs, people and cables - but not, seemingly, human hair that is still attached.

Too close to home

While a person's home is his or her castle, it can also the source of seriously painful and embarrassing accidents that require medical attention.

Doctors in Saudi Arabia got quite a shock when they x-rayed a toddler and saw that he had swallowed a metallic SpongeBob SquarePants pendant.

Doctors couldn't believe their eyes when they saw this familiar face on the x-ray

The item, seen in stunning detail in the image above, was removed from the 16-month-old baby boy's oesophagus without complications.

A closer look at the hairball doctors removed Picture: EUROPICS

A teen in Kyrgyzstan was rushed to hospital unable to eat and when doctors cut open the 18-year-old's swollen stomach they discovered this giant hairball, which had formed over many years of the girl compulsively eating her own hair and locks she picked up off the floor.

Statistically speaking, most British people are more likely to be injured at home than anywhere else.

Don't whatever you do, let the kids anywhere near a trampoline, with the device accounting for around half of all domestic sports injuries requiring hospital treatment among children. Safety experts say children jumping on one with an adult or a crowded trampoline, are the most likely to end in tears and a trip to an A&E unit.

Barbequing at home can cause unfortunate accidents, with a quarter of us admitting to cooking with one, that is operating a large open flame, while drunk. Gazebos, wooden furniture and sheds are often accidentally set alight in the warmer months, safety experts say. Tipsy grillers could explain the 2,000 individuals admitted to A&E units each year with barbeque-related injuries.

Depending on the damage, it seems some of us nurse our wounds in silence.

Around a third of UK adults will feel more than a slight ache or pain as a direct result of bedroom antics, with carpet burns, cricked necks and bruised shoulders among the nation's most common sex injuries.

641,"The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

The ship could now pose an important threat to the American public, as the ship is believed to be infested with thousands of starving rats possibly carrying the ebola virus. Many of the witnesses who came across the ship over the last months, have indeed reported seeing the rodents feeding off the crew’s bodies as the ship went by. Experts fear that these animals could now spread the disease to humans and other animals on the continent, creating an uncontrolable ebola pandemic in the United States.

The ship is believed to be infested with thousands of ebola-ridden rats, fear local health authorities

The Guinean Luck has been reported multiple times in the Atlantic Ocean, drifting away slowly along the North Equatorial Current towards the American continent. It has been sighted almost a dozen times since November 2014, by various ships sailing north of the Antilles. It was last reported to have been seen by fishermen, only a few nautical miles North of the territorial waters of Bahamas.

Despite their efforts, the American authorities have not been able to locate the ghost ship, but some recent satellite pictures showing the ship have enabled them to narrow the search area to approximately 400 square nautical miles (nearly 1375 km² or 530 square mile). A total of 324 coast guard ships and 32 helicopters have already been affected to the search operations, forming the largest search force ever created by the U.S. coast guard.

Ships and officers of the U.S. Coast Guard from the entire East Coast have been mobilized in a desperate attempt to find and sink the ship before it reaches America.

Experts and analysts estimate that the ship’s actual course and speed will bring it to land or be washed ashore in Southern Florida over the next weeks, probably near the densely populated Miami area. The authorities remain confident however, that the ship will be found and sunk before it reaches the coast.",ship left sierra leone july destination mexican city tampico six day leaving port freetown captain ship reported radio communication three crew member beginning show distressing symptom suggested could infected ebola ship changing course head towards cape verde get medical help last time crew heard men board presumed died day later ship could pose important threat american public ship believed infested thousand starving rat possibly carrying ebola virus many witness came across ship last month indeed reported seeing rodent feeding crew body ship went expert fear animal could spread disease human animal continent creating uncontrolable ebola pandemic united state ship believed infested thousand ebola ridden rat fear local health authority guinean luck reported multiple time atlantic ocean drifting away slowly along north equatorial current towards american continent sighted almost dozen time since november various ship sailing north antilles last reported seen fisherman nautical mile north territorial water bahamas despite effort american authority able locate ghost ship recent satellite picture showing ship enabled narrow search area approximately square nautical mile nearly km square mile total coast guard ship helicopter already affected search operation forming largest search force ever created u coast guard ship officer u coast guard entire east coast mobilized desperate attempt find sink ship reach america expert analyst estimate ship actual course speed bring land washed ashore southern florida next week probably near densely populated miami area authority remain confident however ship found sunk reach coast,mexican city tampico six day leaving port freetown captain ship reported radio communication three crew member beginning show distressing symptom suggested could infected ebola ship changing course head towards cape verde get medical help last time crew heard men board presumed died day later ship could pose important threat american public ship believed infested thousand starving rat possibly carrying ebola virus many witness came across ship last month indeed reported seeing rodent feeding crew body ship went expert fear animal could spread disease human animal continent creating
642,"By now, you've probably seen (or even shared) the popular set of photos showing delicious, healthful school lunches from around the world, juxtaposed with a photo of the American equivalent, which of course looks like complete dogshit by comparison.

The photo gallery first appeared on the Tumblr of east coast salad chain Sweetgreen, to promote the company's donations toward healthy food for kids. Sweetgreen arranged and shot the meals themselves, based on the contents international lunches—these pretty, well-lit, probably organic versions of the dishes were never served in an actual cafeteria (as you'd think people would be able to tell from the same tray and background in every photo).

The meals aren't ""fake,"" they were just presented as representative of the kinds of dishes you'd find in various countries. But things started to get weird when sites began removing that context, replacing Sweetgreen's USA photo with a different one, and adding rants about Michelle Obama. Curse her and her totalitarian program of produce and whole grains!

See, for example, the Daily Mail's story ""The School Lunches That Shame America,"" which does nothing to imply that the Sweetgreen photos aren't from actual school lunches, and an even worse Conservative Tribune post that was called out on Snopes. At least the Daily Mail version sources the gross mystery meat photo—it's tater tot casserole, by the way—to its origins on Twitter; the Conservative Tribune piece doesn't bother.

If America should be ashamed of its school lunches, it's not because they don't live up to a bunch of restaurant-quality food porn shot by an actual restaurant.

644,"Apple is in the process of shutting down the Beats streaming music service that it bought in May for $3 billion, according to a report in TechCrunch.

The move would be curious, as Apple paid what many considered to be a hefty sum for the headphones and streaming music service at the time.

It doesn't necessarily mean Apple's lost interest in streaming music, however. More likely it's an effort to unify brands, said the report.

According to sources interviewed by TechCrunch, engineers working on Beats have already been moved to other projects, like iTunes.

647,"With Apple Watch’s launch day edging ever closer, the company is reportedly preparing to make some changes at its global chain of stores in order to accommodate the most expensive version of its new smartwatch.

The tech company is said to be bringing tailor-made safes to its retail locations for the secure overnight storage of its gold Apple Watches, a move that it hopes will help deter nefarious types from considering a late-night shopping expedition of the smash ‘n’ grab variety.

The specially designed safes will hold demo devices as well as on-sale stock, and come equipped with MagSafe chargers so the demo units can begin each day fully charged, a source told 9to5Mac.

Related: Apple’s watch changes everything. Or does it?

The smartwatch model set for the special treatment – the Apple Watch Edition – incorporates a case crafted from 18-karat gold that Apple claims has been specially developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold. It also features a display protected by polished sapphire crystal.

While it’s rare for Apple Stores to get hit by raids, it has been known to happen. With a new and expensive product about to arrive, it could make the stores more of a target, so it’s little surprise that the company is reportedly taking special measures to deter criminals.

The exact price of this particular version of Apple’s smartwatch is yet to be announced, though considering its premium materials, as well as the fact that the Cupertino company is acting to safeguard units outside of regular trading hours, it’s fair to assume that customers who go for the Edition will be laying down several thousand dollars at the least.

659,"North Koreans may face constant starvation and fear of arbitrary arrest, but their leader Kim Jong Un has problems of his own. While an exchange student in Switzerland, the dictator reportedly became addicted to cheese, which has been progressively ruined his health. The dear leader’s health problems have reached the point where he now walks with a limp.

Switzerland’s service to the world.

The cheese is called Emmental, commonly known as Swiss cheese, and Kim Jong Un is so addicted to the cheese that he has it imported despite multiple sanctions.

The extent of Kim’s obesity and consequent health problems became apparent at a recent ceremony in Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un was appearing to remember the passing of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the modern North Korean state. Kim’s face was swollen, and the dear leader walked with a limp, according to a TV appearance.

His appearance may have honored Kim Il Song in more ways than one. The founder of North Korea was also overweight, and some have suggested the Kim Jong Un stuffs himself to keep up the family image.

As defector Cho Myung-Chu explained,

“North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.”

Kim Jong Un has even tried to enroll North Korean cooks in European cheese making classes and sent envoys to France. The Europeans politely declined rather than having their cheese making technology stolen.

Foreign policy or luxury shopping list?

Cheese isn’t the only luxury the dear leader has a taste for. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, North Korea came out in support of Scottish Independence. The reason? So they could get a hold of real Scotch.

Of course, it’s still a long shot if an independent Scotland would ever conduct trade with the rogue state, but in the end Kim Jong Un has other ways.

Office 39, the North Korean agency responsible for foreign currency reserves, has control of an unknown number of foreign trade companies that manage to allude authorities and skirt international sanctions. That might all change soon as the agency has been struggling with management since the execution of Kim Jong Un’s uncle Jang Song-thaek, who was believed to the be the head of the financial institution.

Lifting the sanctions may do more to eliminate the dear leader than Seth Rogen and James Franco ever could.

If Kim Jong Un continues to consume Swiss cheese as at a rapid pace, the dictator may be in capable of ruling much longer.

661,"You've heard of the third nipple — but what about a third breast?

A Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 104.1 that she spent close to $20,000 on the procedure.

Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. ""It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she said. The surgeon she found couldn't create a silicone areola, though, so she had one tattooed onto the implant, which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach.

While Tridevil's dream is to star in an MTV reality show, she told the radio station she had the surgery to become ""unattractive to men"" in addition to gaining fame. ""I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

Tridevil also noted that her parents are displeased with the surgery — her mother no longer speaks to her, and her father ""really isn't happy"" but has ""accepted it,"" she said. --Meghan DeMaria

665,"DEVELOPING: Three Afghan National Army officers who vanished from a Cape Cod military base where they had been taking part in a training exercise have reportedly been found near Niagara Falls, where they were trying to cross into Canada.

The men, reported missing by the Massachusetts National Guard, were first reported missing Saturday night at Joint Base Cape Cod late Saturday. A statement identified the soldiers as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, 48, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, 18, and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar, 20.

A federal source told MyFoxBoston.com the men were caught at the border on Monday. The report could not be confirmed.

Earlier, Pentagon officials who spoke to Fox News said they did not feel that the missing soldiers posed a public threat. U.S. military officials told The Associated Press that the men arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11. They were last seen during a day off at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady told the Cape Cod Times that the men “had the freedom to come and go.”

""If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,” he said.

Base and exercise officials were working with local and state authorities to locate the soldiers, who were taking part in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation exercise.

The exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

Col. George Harrington, battle group commander for the exercise, told the Cape Cod Times that the day the soldiers disappeared was a chance for participants to visit Cape Cod beaches and be treated to a traditional lobster boil back on the base.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations, including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday. There are about a dozen Afghan soldiers still taking part in the exercise.

A Cape Cod Times reporter who attended a training exercise on Friday observed that none of the soldiers involved were carrying weapons.

This year is the first time the exercise has taken place on U.S. soil since 2006, the Cape Cod Times reported. The events are usually held in South Asia.

""This is a valuable opportunity for the Massachusetts National Guard and is personally rewarding,"" Harrington told the newspaper.

668,"Before Apple unveiled the Apple Watch last September, reports indicated the device would come with 10 sensors to track health and fitness data, leading some healthcare professionals to find the unveiled Apple Watch's health features disappointing. In a new report, The Wall Street Journal offers a look at the original Apple Watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems.

Apple began developing the watch about four years ago, with a focus on health and fitness. It’s not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development, but the watch was especially challenging, people familiar with the matter said. Internally, the project became known as a “black hole” sucking in resources, one of these people said.The Apple Watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin, allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG. Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user's blood. However, a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused Apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product.

The skin conductivity features didn't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin, while results varied depending on how tight an Apple Watch was worn on users' wrists. Additionally, if Apple decided to use the health data to provide ""health or behavioral advice"", the Cupertino company would have to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators.

While these features were dropped for the first version of the Apple Watch, sources tell the WSJ that they could appear in future versions of the device, echoing a Reuters report from September.

Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's objective with Apple Watch is to ""change the way people live their lives"" and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do, which includes activity monitoring, reminding users to stand up after a certain time period, and non-verbal communication with friends. Apple is currently asking developers to have their Apple Watch apps ready by mid-February, with some developers traveling to Apple's Cupertino headquarters for help.

Cook has confirmed the Apple Watch will launch in April. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter, with half of those units being the entry Apple Watch Sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel Apple Watch.

673,"Three Afghanistan National Army soldiers who went missing Saturday night from a Regional Cooperation training exercise at Camp Edwards in Sandwich have been found on near the Canadian border, according to sources close to the investigation.

Details on where the men were found, as well as whether they have been detained, have not been provided.

The three men are senior military officers from Afghanistan and were cleared by the US State Department to participate in the exercise, according to Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

US Central Command, who led the investigation, notified The Massachusetts National Guard along with state and local law enforcement of the missing soldiers. However, the state and local agencies were not involved in an active search, Maj. Andrew Aranda, a spokesperson for US Central Command, told Boston.com.

The three men, who speak English, were last seen Saturday while chaperoned to the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis. The Department of Defense has not officially released photos to the public of the missing soldiers. State and local officials have also not been provided with official photos and it’s unclear whether they will given any to work with, Aranda said.

Although the soldiers are considered by military standards as Absent Without Official Leave, they are legally allowed to be in the US under documentation similar to a tourist visa.

“We invited them to the country, they’re allowed to be here,” Aranda said. “Right now, tips will be share with all of the appropriate agencies.”

There are 200 people from six nations participating in the exercise, including 15 officers and senior enlisted personnel from Afghanistan, said Sahady. The two-week annual exercise, sponsored this year by US Central Command, is designed to strengthen relationships between the US and participating nations. The soldiers arrived at Joint Base Cape Cod on Sept. 11.

Non-US soldiers underwent a thorough security tracking and vetting process—known as “Leahy vetting”—before being granted approval to participate.

“Not all 200 people are locked down on base,” Sahady told Boston.com. At some points during their stay, participants are cleared to leave for dinner or to participate in activities off base without restrictions, he said.

Federal and military officials said the men are not considered a threat to the public.

“All we’re worried about right now is for their safety,” Aranda said.

This is not the first reported case of Afghan nationals who have gone missing while undergoing a training program in the US.

675,"A female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance movement after a picture of her making a peace sign was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter has reportedly been beheaded by Isis.

The woman, known by the pseudonym Rehana, was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the embattled Syrian border town after a journalist tweeted a picture of her making a 'V-sign', claiming that she'd personally killed 100 Isis militants.

The message was retweeted over 5,000 times, but there are now claims Rehana, who fought for the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, may have been killed after gruesome pictures began circulating on Twitter of an Isis fighter purportedly holding aloft her head.

A female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance movement after a picture of her making a peace sign was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter has reportedly been beheaded by Isis

Her death - reported on several sites including 9News.com - however, is unconfirmed and at the time of writing the YPG (People's Defense Unit) and YPJ have yet to respond to MailOnline's request for a comment.

Perched on the other side of the Turkish border, the Syrian town of Kobane has been under an intense assault by Isis, or the so-called Islamic State, for more than a month. The town - surrounded on the east, south and west by Isis - is being defended by Kurdish forces in Syria.

Among those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood.

In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women.

Brave: Thousands of Kurdish women are fighting Isis in Syria

These female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region.

The Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary.

One Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher.

Now, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town.

The 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria.

'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?'

After more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.'

There is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women

The campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey.

Suicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory.

Early this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces.

Haj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in.

Surrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday.

679,"In a story straight out of a Russian folk tale, Igor Vorozhbitsyn was walking to his favorite fishing spot in Northern Russia when a bear leaped out of the woods and pinned him down, swiping and clawing at him. Mauled and bleeding, Vorozhbitsyn thought he was about to die.

And then Justin Bieber‘s “Baby” started playing on his phone.

“‘I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said, according to the Daily Mail. “‘I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste.” (Okay, this isn’t the most romantic Russian folk tale.)

According to bear experts, bears are easily scared away by sudden, loud noises, ideally made with air horns, yelling, or, apparently, the tinny screeches emitted by douchebag teenyboppers allegedly “singing.”

Vorozhbitsyn survived after he used his phone to call for help, and has made a full recovery. As to why a burly, 42-year-old Russian man has “Baby” as his ringtone: “My granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.” Uh huh.

680,"Isis fighter denies claim and says organ-harvesting 'would bring in peanuts'

Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations is calling on the UN Security Council to investigate allegations that Isis is harvesting organs, telling ministers: ""We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

Mohamed Alhakim claimed militants are harvesting the organs as a way of financing the extremist group’s activities.

He also told journalists doctors in Mosul were “executed” for refusing to harvest organs, the Associated Press reports.

Mr Alhakim said bodies with surgical incisions and missing organs had been discovered in shallow mass graves.

He was earlier speaking to the UN council about the state of affairs in Iraq, where he also accused Isis of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

However, Elijah J. Magnier, Al Rai's chief international correspondent, said Mr Alhakim’s claims should be treated cautiously. He told The Independent: “Isis doesn't have the market in this current global war against it to be engaged in this business [organ harvesting]. This requires contacts that Isis is losing.”

An Isis fighter was also quick to deny claims made by Mr Alhakim, saying the group would not have time to collect the organs of those they killed.

He was quoted by Mr Magnier as saying: “If [these claims were] true, this would be a general policy for Isis that it would not be possible to hide.

""People are shot in the head, beheaded, bodies thrown in the desert, others left in the battle field and more were dropped in deep wells. Fighters don't have the time to stop in the battle field and collect bodies of their own fighters.

“So how could we collect bodies of those we kill and transport them to sell their organs? ""

Another fighter said it would be easier to harvest organs from prisoners but the group chooses not to, saying: “Organs are preserved naturally in prisoners and could be harvested when needed.

""It is easier to harvest organs from prisoners than from the dead, which is not the case.""

The militant stressed that organ-selling would not raise substantial funds to maintain the group, saying: “The West is trying to find out where our funding comes from. This 'organ selling' would bring in peanuts in comparison what an Isis army needs each day.""

Some of Isis's known sources of finance include oil and taxes on every house, shop, vehicle and any goods crossing into Isis controlled areas.

Isis also reportedly imposes fines for civilians caught breaking rules in Raqqa, the group's Syrian stronghold. Activists recently spoke of the plight faced by citizens living under the group's self-declared caliphate, who face being publicly flogged, paying huge fines and even reportedly execution for 'crimes' such as smoking.",isi fighter denies claim say organ harvesting would bring peanut iraq ambassador united nation calling un security council investigate allegation isi harvesting organ telling minister body come examine clear missing certain part mohamed alhakim claimed militant harvesting organ way financing extremist group activity also told journalist doctor mosul executed refusing harvest organ associated press report mr alhakim said body surgical incision missing organ discovered shallow mass graf earlier speaking un council state affair iraq also accused isi crime genocide targeting certain ethnic group however elijah j magnier al rai chief international correspondent said mr alhakim claim treated cautiously told independent isi market current global war engaged business organ harvesting requires contact isi losing isi fighter also quick deny claim made mr alhakim saying group would time collect organ killed quoted mr magnier saying claim true would general policy isi would possible hide people shot head beheaded body thrown desert others left battle field dropped deep well fighter time stop battle field collect body fighter could collect body kill transport sell organ another fighter said would easier harvest organ prisoner group chooses saying organ preserved naturally prisoner could harvested needed easier harvest organ prisoner dead case militant stressed organ selling would raise substantial fund maintain group saying west trying find funding come organ selling would bring peanut comparison isi army need day isi known source finance include oil tax every house shop vehicle good crossing isi controlled area isi also reportedly imposes fine civilian caught breaking rule raqqa group syrian stronghold activist recently spoke plight faced citizen living group self declared caliphate face publicly flogged paying huge fine even reportedly execution crime smoking,isi fighter denies claim say organ harvesting would bring peanut iraq ambassador united nation calling un security council investigate allegation isi harvesting organ telling minister body come examine clear missing certain part mohamed alhakim claimed militant harvesting organ way financing extremist group activity also told journalist doctor mosul executed refusing harvest organ associated press report mr alhakim said body surgical incision missing organ discovered shallow mass graf earlier speaking un council state affair iraq also accused isi crime genocide
681,"A man at New York City's LaGuardia Airport was removed from a plane after the Christmas spirit turned out to be too much for him.

As he was boarding American Airlines Flight 1140, headed to Dallas on Tuesday, an airline employee wished him a ""Merry Christmas,"" according to the New York Post.

He lectured the employee about how it was inappropriate to say that to everyone, because not everyone celebrates the holiday. Unfortunately that was not the end of it. The Post:

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a “merry Christmas.” That was the last straw.

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

The crew was unable to calm the man, and he was eventually removed from the flight (to the cheers of the other passengers).

The flight left LaGuardia about 40 minutes late, according to FlightAware.

For proper greeting etiquette, Mashable turns to Miss Manners, who says annoyance at ""Merry Christmas"" is understandable but ""friendly overtures require pleasant replies.""

""While some people are offended by 'Christmas,' because they do not celebrate it, even more are offended by 'merry' because they do not feel it,"" she says.

But even though it's proper to respond to a well-intentioned greeting in kind, the holiday spirit can be a little overwhelming this time of year.

Just because I'll be stuck in a plane all day doesn't mean I can't be obnoxiously festive. Merry Christmas, yall!pic.twitter.com/YxShwZjF7C

685,"New details are surfacing about what happened when Joan Rivers was having surgery and a source has revealed to CNN that her doctor took a selfie inside the operating room while she was under anesthesia.

The 81-year-old comedian was scheduled to receive just an endoscopy at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, but after the clinic’s medical doctor Lawrence Cohen finished the procedure, an unidentified doctor performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords.

Investigators think that Joan‘s vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy, which caused oxygen to stop flowing to her lungs. This led to her going into cardiac arrest.

Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director” following Joan‘s death. Despite this, the clinic denies that the vocal cord biopsy was performed at the clinic.",new detail surfacing happened joan river surgery source revealed cnn doctor took selfie inside operating room anesthesia year old comedian scheduled receive endoscopy yorkville endoscopy clinic clinic medical doctor lawrence cohen finished procedure unidentified doctor performed unplanned biopsy vocal cord investigator think joan vocal cord began swell biopsy caused oxygen stop flowing lung led going cardiac arrest dr cohen currently performing procedure currently serving medical director following joan death despite clinic denies vocal cord biopsy performed clinic,joan river surgery source revealed cnn doctor took selfie inside operating room anesthesia year old comedian scheduled to receive endoscopy yorkville endoscopy clinic clinic medical doctor lawrence cohen finished procedure currently serving medical director following joan death despite clinic denies vocal cord biopsy performed clinic denies vocal cord biopsy performed clinic .
697,"If you've been anywhere even remotely near a computer today, you've probably heard that Argentina's president recently adopted a young Jewish man to stop him from turning into a werewolf. And why not—it's internet gold! Also, as it turns out, not even remotely true.

According to the Washington Post, the story of the day is as follows:

A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it.... The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.
While, yes, seventh sons and daughters in Argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter (read: not the adopted child) of the country's president, as The Guardian points out, Jewish werewolf-hood has no part in the tradition. Which is fairly evident from Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's tweets depicting the country's newly announced first Jewish godson.

Top translation: They brought me a menorah. They asked me to light it. Bottom translation: I didn't realize it, but their visit coincided with Hanukkah.

But, as The Guardian points out, this nice, totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient, werewolf-esque myth called the lobizón:

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón(Argentina's equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colorful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

In fact, the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children. There is an actual, century-old tradition in which every seventh child born to an Argentinian family is eligible to become the president's godchild—a practice originating from Czarist Russia. The tale of the lobizón, on the other hand, started amongst Argentina's gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the president's newly minted godson.

So sorry to burst your bubble, internet—no werewolf Jewish godsons this time. But hey, at least it got us talking about this again. [The Guardian]

Some sites are claiming it’s from a Peruvian TV show, but it’s not.

It’s actually a mockumentary by the sports brand Everlast and this campaign to stop street harassment.

As such, it’s staged, but anyway – the video purports to show how some men who whistle and make sexist comments on the streets were tricked by a film team.

The team played out dressing the abusers’ mothers differently and disguising them…

…waiting for the men to start catcalling…

….and then giving them hell.

Now, it didn’t actually happen. That said, El País actually claimed that the campaign is based on interviews with men who accidentally harassed female relatives by mistake. And the message seems to be getting through. The original has had over 5 million views.

The campaign also features Natalia Málaga, a celebrated volleyball player and coach.

Back in 2013 she and Everlast put this advert together, in which women drivers who were being harassed by men could tweet their location and she’d punch their cars with her own giant boxing-glove car.

705,"A 25-year-old South African man has lost the use of his penis following an acid attack by his angry 17-year-old girlfriend. She got mad after a video of them having sex went viral.

The girl apparently cannot be named as she is under age. According to African Eye News Service (AENS), on January 17, after discovering a pornographic video of her and her boyfriend having sex had gone viral online, she went to a tavern in Cork village, close to Hazyview in Mpumalanga, South Africa where her boyfriend was drinking with friends.

South Africa – Girl poured acid on boyfriend Humphrey Khoza’s penis after he released sex tape | Metro News http://t.co/FhP8qLIBw4?

— Mark Nixon (@markalannixon) February 3, 2015

Metro reports on arrival at the tavern the South African schoolgirl immediately doused Humphrey Khoza’s genitals with battery acid. Khoza himself said everything happened in the blink of an eye

“Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn’t realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog.”

“She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.”

According to Khoza, the pair had been dating since December and while they agreed to have sex, the girl was unaware that he was filming it using his laptop computer, but he never meant to show it to anyone else.

“I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don’t know how it got onto social media.”

According to Times Live, AENS has seen the offending video to verify the claim. In it Khoza can be seen pushing the girl, wearing her school uniform, on to the bed. They report that she didn’t appear to notice they were being filmed while having sex, but that it was consensual.

Khoza did say that he was lucky to be alive, despite the fact that his penis will never work again. He apparently now has to urinate through a tube and is facing further surgery.

Even though he has been advised to press charges against the girl, the South African man doesn’t see any point.

“Even if I press charges it is useless because it won’t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.”

In other recent news on South Africa, the Inquisitr recently reported on the tragic shooting in a Johannesburg shopping mall which injured seven people, three critically.

710,"The family of slain journalist James Foley are claiming Obama Administration officials repeatedly threatened them, asserting that they could be prosecuted for supporting terrorism if they paid a ransom to the ISIS militants holding their son.

Both Foley’s mother and brother made the allegations this week, according to ABC News. The threats, which were made to the Foley family over the summer, reportedly came from a highly decorated military official who serves on the White House’s National Security Council. Five current or former officials with knowledge of the Foley case made the same allegation to ABC News in recent weeks.

“Three times he intimidated us with that message,” Diane Foley claimed. “We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try.”

The NSC released a statement on Thursday, in which spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden addressed the implications of paying ransom to terrorist groups.

“Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately.”

Officials also told Foley’s family not to deal with the press, and indicated that the government would not exchange prisoners or take military action to rescue James Foley, according to CNN. Foley’s brother Michael also claimed that he was directly threatened with prosecution.

“Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,” Diane Foley said, adding, “As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.”

As The Inquisitr has previously reported, James Foley was murdered by ISIS militants, and a video posted online on August 19 shows his summary execution by beheading. In the weeks following his death, it was revealed that the United States had launched a mission to recover Foley and other captives this summer inside Syria, though the hostages had been moved by the time commandos arrived.

Foley’s family said that the threats slowed their fundraising efforts to obtain the ransom, as they feared donors would also face prosecution.

711,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
Tawil was adopted under a law passed in the 1920s to counteract a legend that a seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
Under the law, the boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.
On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.
The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”
She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

717,"Three soldiers from Afghanistan's army, who were training in the United States, were reportedly caught at the Canadian border after they vanished during a chaperoned trip to a mall in Cape Cod, Massachusetts on Saturday.

Both NBC News and Boston's WCVB-TV reported the three soldiers were apprehended while trying to cross the border into Canada.

The Afghanistan National Army soldiers — MAJ Jan Mohammad Arash, CPT Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and CPT Noorullah Aminyar — were in the country to participate in a military training exercise at Joint Base Cape Cod. Base security personnel reported them missing late Saturday after they visited Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, Massachusetts, on an off-base trip meant to ""introduce them to cultural aspects of American life,"" a U.S. military spokesperson told Mashable.

""There is no indication they pose any threat to the public,"" the spokesperson said Monday morning, adding that they were subjected to the Leahy Vetting process — the State Department basis for foreign security forces' visas that ensures recipients haven't committed human rights abuses.

Gov. Deval Patrick said there was speculation within the military that the soldiers were ""trying to defect.""

The U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise has been in place since 2004 and is meant to promote cooperation between participating forces. It involves five countries and more than 200 participants, the military said. There are about a dozen more Afghan soldiers still participating in the exercise. Military officials from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia are also participants.

Officials at Joint Base Cape Cod, the U.S. Central Command, as well as state and local police are working to locate the three Afghans.

728,"The woman had reportedly taken a nap on the floor

A South Korean woman was taught a lesson about trying to do things the easy way when a robot vacuum cleaner sucked up her hair and left her trapped as she took a nap on the floor of her home.

The unnamed woman, 52, took a break between chores in her Changwon home in southeast South Korea.

She later awoke in agony after the machine mistook her hair for dust, forcing her to call the fire brigade with a “desperate plea” for help, The Guardian reports.

Emergency workers quickly worked to untangle her from the vacuum, which had ingested about 5cm of her hair.

Autonomous robot vacuum cleaners are programmed to clean and perform other basic household tasks at set times, suggesting the woman had forgotten what time hers was set to clean the floor at.

733,"THIS seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain’s biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 15-metres wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of ‘Crabzilla’, others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank — or is simply a playful hoax.

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour — dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable — an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image — sent to him by a follower — showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

He said: ‘At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, “that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood”.

‘It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

‘Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.’

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 3.5-metres.

735,"A new video allegedly depicts the beheading of captive American journalist Steven Sotloff, the Associated Press reported. If the video does indeed depict Sotloff's death, it would make him the second American journalist to be executed by agents of the Islamic State (IS), sometimes known as ISIS or ISIL.

Previously, ISIS released footage of a British jihadi ('Jihadi John') killing Jim Foley, an American journalist snateched while on freelance assignment in Syria. In that video, after executing Foley, the militant brings out a man identified as Sotloff and says his life ""depends upon…[Obama's]...next decision."" The man cites ""aggression"" against IS by the U.S. and says, ""to deny Muslims their safety of living under the caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

In response to the release of the Foley video, the U.S. ramped up its attacks against ISIS. President Obama asked for the help and support of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and battling the group, which he said ""has no place in the 21st century.""

Newsweek Magazine is Back In Print

Sotloff has been missing in Syria since Aug. 4, 2013, when he was abducted after crossing into Syria from Turkey.

His mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded directly with ISIS's leader for her son's safe return. “I am sending this message to you, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Quraishi al-Hussaini, the caliph of the Islamic State,"" she said in a video obtained by The New York Times. ""I am Shirley Sotloff. My son Steven is in your hands. You, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child,” she said. “I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.”

The video of Sotloff's purported execution was uncovered by SITE Intelligence Group, which told Newsweek the video is authentic.

739,"A wicked aunt cut her three-year-old nephew’s penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her phone.

Xue Paan, 37, was sending text messages to her boyfriend while sitting on the toilet when toddler Qiang Qiang walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile.

But instead of giving him the phone, the fuming aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and severed the boy’s penis while his mother was visiting a next-door neighbour in Luohe, a city in central China’s Henan Province.

Horrified mum Cai Tuan, 27, said: “I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

Residents in shock ... Luohe is the Chinese city where the terrible incident occurred.
Residents in shock ... Luohe is the Chinese city where the terrible incident occurred.
“I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.

“Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

“Next to him was a knife and his penis.

“It was simply horrific.

“My sister, his aunt, had gone.”

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the penis and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said: “Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

“However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

A police spokesman said: “The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

The woman now faces 5 years in jail.

745,"HP's home-focused and business divisions have frequently seemed at odds with each other, and apparently the company agrees. The Wall Street Journal claims that the tech giant is about to split into two companies, one focused on PCs and the other dedicated solely to corporate hardware and services. If the report is accurate, the separation could be announced as early as Monday. The exact reasoning behind the move hasn't been mentioned, but the PC-centric group would be headed by one of its existing executives, Dion Weisler; current CEO Meg Whitman would run the business group and keep an eye on the other company by serving as its chairman of the board. However true the rumor may be, such a move wouldn't be all that surprising -- much of the computing industry has been restructuring and rescaling to cope with a world where the PC's role is rapidly evolving.

746,"You won’t believe this one.

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

747,"In a blog entry on Six Colors should be noted that in different product images of the Apple Watch Edition -- btw. the most expensive version with 18-carat gold -- it is to realize that the point on the crown of the digital crown corresponds to the strap color. This raises the question of whether buyers  are enabled to color-adjust the crown.

There are several ways, as Six Colors is mentioning. The first would be very interesting, but it is extremely unlikely: Accordingly, the crown could have a small LCD screen that when you change the bracelet, it displays the corresponding color. Much more plausible, however, the idea that when you buy a color, the point can be selected which should appear on the crown. This would be independent of the bracelet. In addition, it may possible Apple allows a replacement of the crown, so that the color can be changed as needed.

In the end, however, we can only speculate. Only at the official launch, we'll be able to have certainty. There are also signs that only at the Apple Watch Edition this may possible, other versions will probably have to life without such an option.

749,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough says no threats were made to the families of slain U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff for considering ransom payments to their captors. McDonough, making the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, said the administration merely explained what the law is regarding such ransom payments: They're prohibited.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""That's our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Foley and Sotloff were executed by Islamic State militants, who posted videos of the beheadings on the Internet. Foley's parents said Friday the government threatened them with prosecution if they tried to raise money to pay a ransom for their son, who was kidnapped in 2012.

On CNN's ""State of the Union"" and ABC's ""This Week,"" McDonough pushed President Obama's plan for fighting Islamic State, or ISIS, militants, and urged Congress to fund anti-ISIS groups in Syria. He pledged, however, there is no intention to send U.S. soldiers into the area. Rather, he said, the plan features bolstering local fighting forces.

""It's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL [the way the administration refers to ISIS],"" he said on ""State of the Union.""

On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and ""Fox News Sunday"" McDonough acknowledged the United States is at war with ISIS and called the situation ""complicated.""

""Success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States -- an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq or otherwise,"" McDonough said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, however, said too much emphasis is being put on the use of the word ""war."" On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Kerry said the terminology doesn't matter.

""In terms of al Qaeda, which we have used the word 'war' with, yeah ... we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. And in the same context if you want to use it, yes, we are at war with ISIL in that sense,"" Kerry said. ""But I think it's waste of time to focus on that. Frankly, lets consider what we have to do to degrade and defeat ISIL.

""What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the administration's approach ""delusional.""

In a speech Wednesday, Obama said the U.S. would conduct bombing raids on ISIS targets but would not commit combat troops to the fight.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion.

“You cannot create an army to destroy ISIL without an American component. … This is war.”

Gens. Paul Eaton and Jim Dubik said on ""State of the Union"" Obama's plan could work but success will depend on what follows.

750,"Iraq has urged the United Nations to investigate Islamic State terrorists' bloody trade in human organs after the Iraqi ambassador said doctors are being executed for not harvesting body parts.

Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul over the past few weeks.

ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques.

Lucrative: ISIS has set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

Speaking of ISIS' organ harvesting operations, Mr Alhakim said: 'We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.'

He also said a dozen doctors have been 'executed' in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Mr Alhakim briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of 'crimes of genocide' in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that last month alone, 790 people were killed by terrorism and armed conflict in the country.

He also noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that IS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that 'it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day'. He used an acronym for the group.

Making them rich: Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul (pictured) over the past few weeks

Mr Mladenov said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized over the past year.

The Sunni militants currently controls around a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed its strict interpretation of Sharia law in its self-declared caliphate - subjecting a population of around four million people to a brutal campaign of rape and massacre.

'Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,' Mr Mladenov said, using an alternative acronym for the group known as ISIS in the West and Daesh in Arab nations.

The shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website in December, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.

He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

Militants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters

The al-Monitor report also claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.

'[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.'

The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'

Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.

While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.

Security: ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques

Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit.

The militant, who spoke English with a U.S. accent, appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya.

Brandishing a knife, he declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.'

The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously.

U.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria.

Professor Erik Thomas, a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University, believes he 'sounds like an American' with some Arabic influence, based on some of word pronunciations.

One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'

Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market.

Yesterday it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men.

Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each.

The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey.

The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year.

The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC.

It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance.",iraq urged united nation investigate islamic

751,"In a bid to finance its operations, the Islamic State group might be harvesting human organs, Iraq’s ambassador to the U.N. told the intergovernmental organization on Tuesday, and asked the Security Council to investigate the allegations.

In the past few weeks, authorities have discovered bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other organs in several shallow mass graves, leading many to believe that the extremist group might be harvesting these organs to fund its caliphate, Mohamed Alhakim, the Iraqi envoy to the U.N., reportedly said.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” The Associated Press (AP) quoted Alhakim as saying. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.”

The official also said that ISIS had executed several doctors in the northern Iraqi town of Mosul for refusing to harvest organs from its victims. Alhakim also accused ISIS of being guilty of “crimes of genocide” as it targets ethnic groups.

“These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shi'ite, Sunni, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak or Yazidis,” Russia’s RT news agency quoted Alhakim as saying.

The U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that there are numerous reports to support the claim that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

“It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day… Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis, most notably the Shi’ite community, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, across the country,” Mladenov told the council, adding that at least 790 people were killed in January during armed conflicts in Iraq.

In December, al-Monitor had reported that foreign doctors were harvesting organs for ISIS in Mosul.

758,"A Russian fisherman says that Justin Bieber saved his life…sort of.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn was on his way to a northern Russia fishing spot when he was suddenly attacked by a bear.

“I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I’d marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,” Vorozhbitsyn told Central European News.

But then, with what turned out to be extremely fortuitous timing, the 42-year-old man’s cell phone started ringing. The Justin Bieber song “Baby” started playing, and the bear — who was either frightened by the sound or who perhaps is a Bieber fan himself and wanted to go easy on a fellow Belieber — fled.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said. “I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste, but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.”

After the bear fled, Vorozhbitsyn called for help and was rescued by fishermen. He is now recovering from the attack, which left him with cuts and bruises around his face and chest.

762,"Apple will begin shipping the Apple Watch in March and will also look to launch its new 12-inch MacBook Air during this quarter, according to a new report by KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo. The analyst also predicted that iPhone shipments would beat expectations for Q1 2015 with over 61 million units shipped, while iPad shipments are expected to total to 10 million units.

Kuo notes that Apple may reveal more details about the Apple Watch before its official launch, revealing specifics on battery life and the start of pre-orders. Most components of the Apple Watch will see high shipments during the quarter, but other key components are expected to see low production yields which may cause a constrained supply. Kuo predicts that Apple will ship 2.8 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015, and his estimate for a March launch falls in line with previous reports.

Rendering of 12-inch MacBook Air done by Martin Hajek
Kuo's estimate for a Q1 2015 launch of the new 12-inch MacBook Air falls in line with a report earlier this month which stated that Apple supplier Quanta Computer was ramping up production of the notebook for a release this quarter. The 12-inch MacBook Air is expected to feature a new ultra-thin, fan-less design with a high resolution Retina display and a low-power Intel Core M processor. The notebook is also said to be one of the first to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type C connector, which may also be used for charging.

764,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

BuzzFeed News has reached out to her for further comment.

765,"As traditions go this may be the most unbelievable tale you may ever read - the President of Argentina has adopted a Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Christina Fernandez de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family last week at her office to mark the 100-year-old Argentine custom.

According to legend the seventh son born to a family turns into a ferocious ""el lobison"" or werewolf – on the first Friday after his 13th birthday.

The country began to introduce adoption procedures to quell the fear of the people in the 19th century who believed their sons could turn into werewolfs (the fear was so extreme in some cases people murdered their baby boys).

It has become customary since 1907 but formally established in 1973 for the president to adopt their seventh sons and daughters who also receive a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Tawil's parents wrote to the president in 1993 for their son to be the first Jewish boy to be adopted and they got their wish this year, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

Until 2009, the tradition only applied to Catholic children.

Last week's unusual ceremony between the president and Tawil, witnessed by his parents and three brothers, happened at the same time as Hanukkah - the eight-day Jewish festival that commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem in 165 BC.

Fernandez de Kirchner tweeted: ""I didn't know it but his visit coincided with the Hanukkah celebration. The father said it wasn't a coincidence.""

768,"The odds of bringing a big-league franchise to the city of Las Vegas have always seemed long for a lot of reasons, but that may soon change and it might just be the NHL that brings top-level professional sports to Sin City. A recent report suggests that an NHL team coming to Las Vegas isn't so much a pipe dream as it is a certainty.

Tony Gallagher of the Vancouver Province reported that commissioner Gary Bettman, who has so often said “we're not looking to expand” or “we have no plans for expansion” so many times over the last decade, is changing his tune on expansion.

More from the Province:

…Recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when [the league will expand].

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

“Done deal.” Sounds almost too good to be true and it may be, but there has been movement on the expansion front recently.

UPDATE: NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly denied the report Wednesday morning in comments to TVA Sports:

""[Expansion to Las Vegas is] not in our plans, there is absolutely nothing new in that,"" he has admitted to TVASports.ca.

And if it were an organization struggling with financial difficulties, as the Florida Panthers, who moved rather in the ""Sin City""?

""We have no move in sight, whether in the case of the Panthers, or any other team besides,"" replied Daly.

Even in light of the league's denial, there's still reason to believe the NHL will have to soon expand and cities like Las Vegas and another rumored candidate Seattle would help expand the league's footprint.

Here's why it's not completely outlandish to envision Vegas as a future NHL city. For one, they have two open spots in the Western Conference to even things out and bring some competitive balance. The Eastern Conference currently has 16 teams, while the West has 14. If the NHL expanded to the most long-rumored top candidate of Seattle, that would help even things out. It's definitely not as simple as that, though.

Another barrier for Las Vegas would have been an arena, but that may no longer be an issue. The city has been home to minor-league hockey for years, but now Vegas is in the process of building a new arena however with the aim of bringing either an NHL or NBA team to Vegas.

MGM and AEG, owner of the Los Angeles Kings, are teaming up on the project that broke ground in Las Vegas in May. The new arena is due to open in 2016 and will have 20,000 seats, but a projected capacity of 17,500 for hockey. The company building the arena, ICON, is also building the Edmonton Oilers' new arena. Kings great Luc Robitaille was on hand at the ground-breaking.

There has long been a desire for Las Vegas to finally get a major league franchise and there are likely more than a few individuals out there that would be willing to bet on Sin City to support a big team.

But here are the issues that make it seem a little less likely. There are other markets like Quebec City or Southern Ontario, that have long been pushing for NHL teams and would appear safer bets than Las Vegas. Putting teams in Seattle and Las Vegas would help even out the Western conference, but there could be an uproar if the NHL goes to two more non-traditional markets while strong Canadian markets exist to make money hand over fist.

A recent report from CBC suggested that Canada could support three more NHL teams. The league undoubtedly knows that they could get a lot out of more Canadian markets and also have that new TV rights deal with Rogers, a company that would no doubt love more Canadian markets.

That's where a second report comes in regarding expansion. Howard Bloom of SportsBusinessNews.com reported that the NHL will expand by four teams including Las Vegas, Seattle, Quebec City and Toronto.

Update: In light of Daly's comments, the timeline sure doesn't seem to add up on this one, but it is hardly surprising that the league would come out in strong denial. With expansion ""not in the plans"" now, it doesn't mean it can't be eventually, and possibly soon.

A $1.4 billion figure for combined expansion fees seems a bit high. The last time the NHL expanded between 1997 and 2000, expansion fees were a reported $80 million, which was a $30 million difference from the previous high. In the 14 years since, you better believe that number is way up from $80 million. Either way, the NHL stands to gain quite the influx of cash if they can expand.

The Winnipeg Jets paid a $60 million relocation fee on top of the reported $170 million True North paid to purchase the Atlanta Thrashers. The relocation fee likely wouldn't be in the same range as an expansion fee, but it offers a more recent point of reference.

Talk of widespread expansion is a big step away from what commissioner Gary Bettman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in June:

“Right now, we're not looking to expand. I know Las Vegas is an important city. Whether or not it's a city for the NHL to put a team in is still to be determined. We have not done any investigating as to whether or not the city could support the NHL or looked at potential ownership groups. If the owners were to approve expansion, we would certainly begin looking more closely at Las Vegas and other potential markets.”
It doesn't shut the door, but there's a lot of moving parts to expansion and you'll never hear the NHL commissioner get ahead of himself. It's clear that the gears are in motion on some level, though.

Quebec City is already building an arena that is set to be completed by 2015. The Vegas arena will be ready by 2016. Investors have interest in putting an arena in Markham, Ont., and Hamilton, Ont., has also long been a possible expansion/relocation target.

Seattle meanwhile has yet to break ground on an a new arena, but there has been some movement recently as real estate mogul Victor Coleman is adding some weight to a potential ownership group. He recently met with Chris Hansen, who is working towards bringing an NBA team to Seattle and has promised the city an arena if successful. There were reportedly talks of building the arena if the city secures an NHL team first. Coleman told KING5 News in Seattle that there is a ""clear path"" to bringing the NHL to the city.

A possible 34-team league by 2017 is a bit concerning, however. Could the international talent pool support it? It seems to be a stretch. Diluting the competition should be a major fear as there are a lot of NHL players right now that are just barely scraping by in a 30-team league. You don't have to look any further than a lot of the fourth lines in the league. Thirty-two teams may even be a stretch at that point, but adding 50 new players wouldn't be as straining as trying to add 100.

There are a lot of questions left to be answered and the fact that none of the hockey insiders that are usually on top of the big stories like this have backed up the reports yet certainly takes a little air out of these exciting developments.

Expecting the NHL to expand by 2017 without relocating current teams seems a bit overly-optimistic, but the league is making more money than it ever has and is enjoying growing popularity. More expansion is probably at its most likely since 2000 when the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets entered the league and that offers some serious excitement for some possibly hockey-hungry

770,"The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime, foreign diplomatic sources believe.

“There was an attempt to force him to go back, but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he hasn’t been found yet,” said the diplomatic source.

The architecture student, referred to only by his surname Han, went missing last month, raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jon-un’s once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Han's father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea’s biggest news agency which broke the story, said: “Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

“If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.”

Han’s curious disappearance, which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal, has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime.

Despite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship, France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship.

Han was studying at Paris’ prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012, along with nine other North Koreans, five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five-year course.

""We didn’t decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea, the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads,” said a head teacher at the La Villette school, who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their “Dear Leader”.

The students are kept under close surveillance, she told The Telegraph.

“There is often an Asian man in a three-piece suit waiting in the courtyard, checking up on attendance and if they get good results,” she said.

“When one failed part of his exam and was sent home, a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that wasn’t possible,” she added.

After long denying its existence, the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a “cooperation programme” involving “students from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris” has been in place for the past decade.

It had no further comment.

The programme was set up by Jean-Noël Juttet, a former French ambassador to Japan, who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of “maintaining contact between the two countries”.

Homing in on education, he said the French suggested courses in “priority sectors, like medicine, food or construction” but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field: architecture.

“That was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing,” he told Street Press, an online news site that first uncovered the student programme.

Trained in France, the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel, the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyang’s skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 330-metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink, dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a “new society of leisure”.

Architecture is not Kim Jong-un’s only area of interest in France. In April, it also emerged that the Emmental-loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese-making at a dairy school in eastern France - reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his country’s attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined.

France has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations, including China. In 2011, it emerged that a French neurosurgeon, Francois-Xavier Roux, had secretly treated Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, in 2008 after he had a stroke.

Describing Kim as apparently ""profoundly Francophile”, Dr Roux said: ""He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that.

""He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux, etc.""

Last month, it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong-un’s feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane.

Behind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy, according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot.

“For North Korea, the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris. It would be a small victory for the country,” he told Street Press.

As for France, he said it was a way of keeping channels of communication open: “You can’t send information to North Korea, so welcoming these young students is a rare opportunity to communicate with the country. In the long term, it could be a way of moving things forward.”

An abduction attempt, however, if confirmed, would “definitively scupper any North Korean request for diplomatic recognition from France,"" he said.",son aide north korean leader kim jong un uncle hiding france evading abduction agent communist regime foreign diplomatic source believe attempt force go back thought escaped somewhere france attempt locate found yet said diplomatic source architecture student referred surname han went missing last month raising concern safety believed son close confidant jang song thaek kim jon un powerful uncle executed december last year treason charge han father known killed recently part kim regime purge jang ally park sung jin paris correspondent yonhap south korea biggest news agency broke story said since regime change someone executed relative friend family studying abroad brought home han returned would likely kept political prison executed happened many time knew awaiting escaped han curious disappearance come amid heightened tension north korea america sony entertainment picture hacking scandal lifted lid murky tie france keep communist regime despite official diplomatic relation dictatorship france behind discreet student programme place since north korean student privileged background study architecture paris stated aim return pyongyang launch grandiose architectural project glory dictatorship han studying paris prestigious ecole nationale superieure architecture de paris la villette left north korea paris along nine north korean five posted another architecture school belleville third year five year course decide blue take student north korea decision made french culture ministry answer head said head teacher la villette school recalled surprise first batch student turned wearing badge effigy dear leader student kept close surveillance told telegraph often asian man three piece suit waiting courtyard checking attendance get good result said one failed part exam sent home representative north korean delegation paris wanted take place explain possible added long denying existence french foreign ministry confirmed telegraph cooperation programme involving student north korea trained architecture paris place past decade comment programme set jean l juttet former french ambassador japan said asked french foreign ministry find way maintaining contact two country homing education said french suggested course priority sector like medicine food construction north korean interested one field architecture request came way top insisted much ended agreeing told street press online news site first uncovered student programme trained france land star architect like jean nouvel student supposed help transform pyongyang skyline new cutting edge architectural design ryugyong hotel metre high edifice completed reportedly behind design new ice skating rink dolphinarium sport centre opened last year help north korea become new society leisure architecture kim jong un area interest france april also emerged emmental loving despot ordered three official attend crash course cheese making dairy school eastern france reportedly dissatisfied country attempt dairy production school politely declined france historically kept relatively warm tie communist nation including china emerged french neurosurgeon francois xavier roux secretly treated kim jong il former north korean leader stroke describing kim apparently profoundly francophile dr roux said wanted establish political tie france hiding also knew french cinema well pretty surprised knew french wine pretty well talking difference bourgogne bordeaux etc last month reported pyongyang flew french surgeon operate kim jong un foot state medium pictured walking cane behind university exchange lie complex game parallel diplomacy according north korea expert pierre rigoulot north korea exchange way legitimising pyongyang regime receiving recognition aim sacrifice anything open embassy paris would small victory country told street press france said way keeping channel communication open send information north korea welcoming young student rare opportunity communicate country long term could way moving thing forward abduction attempt however confirmed would definitively scupper north korean request diplomatic recognition france said,yonhap south korea biggest news agency broke story said since regime change someone executed relative friend family studying abroad brought home han returned would likely kept political prison executed happened many time knew awaiting escaped han curious disappearance come amid heightened tension north korea america sony entertainment picture hacking scandal lifted lid murky tie france keep communist regime behind discreet student programme place since north korean student privileged background study architecture paris stated aim return pyongyang launch grandios
771,"Two locations in Ohio and West Virginia serve the item you thought was extinct

Millennial diners, want to sink your teeth into a round cheezy slab of ’90s nostalgia? McDonald’s Pizza has been found living on at two locations in Ohio and West Virginia, according to Canada.com

The two restaurants, out of over 14,000 McDonald’s locations in America, are owned by a man named Greg Mills and located 90 miles apart from one another, the site reports.

It was the explosion in popularity of drive-through restaurants that brought about the demise of the pizza. The ovens were said to have slowed down sales and restaurants weren’t pushing enough pizzas out to justify the expense.

But Judy Norman, an employee at the West Virginia location, told Canada.com that their pizza still sells and she has “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where every so often you get a pizza [order].”

For now, millennials can delight that they now have two places they can take their Teenie Beanie Babies, discuss Hey Arnold! and have a slice of the past.

784,"Saudi Arabia’s national carrier has reportedly decided to impose separate seating on its male and female passengers.

The plan is being implemented by Saudi Airlines due to a rash of complaints from men who said they did not want their wives sitting next to other men, the Daily Mail reported, citing Gulf media.

“There are solutions to this problem… we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudi Airlines’ assistant manager for marketing, Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, was quoted as saying.

According to the report, close relatives will be allowed to sit together.

The plan reportedly also follows recent complaints from male passengers about a “flirty” flight attendant.

Saudi women are not employed as flight attendants by the airline, which instead hires women from other countries, the report said.

Saudi Arabia enforces a strict segregation of the sexes in public spaces, and famously forbids women from driving motor vehicles.

Women are required to wear a headscarf and loose, black robes in public.

Operators of flights to and from Israel have faced similar complaints from men who refused to sit next to women.

An international flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed for half an hour on December 20 after ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refused to sit between two women.

The flight crew of Delta Flight 468 departing John F. Kennedy Airport attempted to find other seats for the men. But other passengers refused to swap seats in protest at their refusal to sit next to female passengers, according to a Friday report by Israel Radio.

The men were finally accommodated by an American passenger who agreed to switch seats.

According to Federal Aviation Authority regulations, a flight is not permitted to take off until all passengers are seated.

In September, an El Al flight was grounded after a group of ultra-Orthodox men refused to sit next to a female passenger, resulting in an 11-hour delay described as a “nightmare” by passengers.

That incident sparked a petition calling on EL AL to protect its female travelers by reserving “a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them — thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off.”",saudi arabia national carrier reportedly decided impose separate seating male female passenger plan implemented saudi airline due rash complaint men said want wife sitting next men daily mail reported citing gulf medium solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger saudi airline assistant manager marketing abdul rahman al fahd quoted saying according report close relative allowed sit together plan reportedly also follows recent complaint male passenger flirty flight attendant saudi woman employed flight attendant airline instead hire woman country report said saudi arabia enforces strict segregation sex public space famously forbids woman driving motor vehicle woman required wear headscarf loose black robe public operator flight israel faced similar complaint men refused sit next woman international flight new york tel aviv delayed half hour december ultra orthodox jewish men refused sit two woman flight crew delta flight departing john f kennedy airport attempted find seat men passenger refused swap seat protest refusal sit next female passenger according friday report israel radio men finally accommodated american passenger agreed switch seat according federal aviation authority regulation flight permitted take passenger seated september el al flight grounded group ultra orthodox men refused sit next female passenger resulting hour delay described nightmare passenger incident sparked petition calling el al protect female traveler reserving row separate sex seating every flight fee passenger need seating pre book seat annoy coerce passenger take change seat thereby avoiding argument bullying delayed take,airline reportedly decided impose separate seating male female passenger plan implemented saudi airline due rash complaint men said want wife sitting next men daily mail reported citing gulf medium solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger saudi arabia national carrier reportedly decided impose separate seating male female passenger plan implemented saudi airline due rash complaint men said want wife sitting next men daily mail reported friday report israel radio men finally accommodated american passenger agreed switch seat resulting hour delay described nightmare passenger incident sparked petition calling el
785,"She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as Tampa Bay’s 10 News revealed Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three-breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept. 16.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prosthesis.”

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance.

However, when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be skeptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Photo: FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for.”

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip, Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple,” which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” on her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different … that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre-surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

It’s not the first time Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges, she offered her attacker an ultimatum, telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women.’”

Everlast found two men who were ""repeat offenders"" and contacted their moms who agreed to dress in disguise and walk past their sons.

The outcome is highly satisfying. After their sons yell some fairly unsavory things, the horrified moms publicly berate them. One of the women actually repeatedly hits her son over the head with her purse after he calls her ""Tasty panties."" It's everything you've ever wanted a catcaller to hear.

791,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in serious discussions to buy Mojang AB, the Swedish company behind the popular ""Minecraft"" video game, The Wall Street Journal said, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.

The deal is be valued at more than $2 billion and could be signed as early as this week, the Journal reported.

""Minecraft"" is a game where players build structures with blocks to protect against nocturnal monsters.

The acquisition will add to Microsoft's Xbox video game business, at a time when the competition in the video game console market is heating up.

Microsoft said in April it had shipped 5 million Xbox One units to retailers worldwide since the launch. In the same month Sony Corp (6758.T) said it had sold more than 7 million PlayStation 4 units as of April 6 and was struggling to keep up with consumer demand.

792,"Once thought to be a key component of Apple's acquisition of Beats, the Beats Music subscription service and accompanying brand will apparently be shuttered, leaving just iTunes-related software services, according to a new report.

Citing five sources at Apple and Beats, TechCrunch reported on Monday that although the exact timetable is unknown, Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music service and brand. People involved in the product are said to have already been moved onto other projects at the company, including iTunes.

If true, the move would be a change from May, when Apple emphasized Beats Music as a key component of its $3 billion purchase of the headphone maker. The Beats Music product received top billing over Beats Electronics in Apple's press release announcing the deal, even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand's most recognizable role.

Observers also believed that the Beats Music service allowed Apple to enter a key subscription market where the iTunes Store and iTunes Radio do not compete. Sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like Spotify and Pandora.

But Beats Music also got off to a slow start, with just 110,000 subscribers as of March. Its performance since being acquired by Apple remains unknown.

The rumor would suggest that Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ""acqui-hires"" of Beats's Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.

Iovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Both he and Dr. Dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for Apple's iTunes business.

When it was announced earlier this year, Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats proved controversial, with critics suggesting that the iPhone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products. But proponents believe the addition of Beats products to Apple's portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete.

Update: In a statement to Re/code, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the TechCrunch rumor is ""not true,"" but did not offer further comment on the matter. The publication cites sources at Apple as saying branding for Beats Music could change in the future, though the streaming service itself will remain active.",thought key component apple acquisition beat beat music subscription service accompanying brand apparently shuttered leaving itunes related software service according new report citing five source apple beat techcrunch reported monday although exact timetable unknown apple plan sunset beat music service brand people involved product said already moved onto project company including itunes true move would change may apple emphasized beat music key component billion purchase headphone maker beat music product received top billing beat electronics apple press release announcing deal even though headphone making side business brand recognizable role observer also believed beat music service allowed apple enter key subscription market itunes store itunes radio compete sale digital album declining recent year customer migrated competing service like spotify pandora beat music also got slow start subscriber march performance since acquired apple remains unknown rumor would suggest apple billion buyout beat really headphone side business well talent credibility brought acqui hire beat jimmy iovine dr dre iovine longtime music industry executive personal friend late apple co founder steve job dr dre considerable sway industry could help secure content apple itunes business announced earlier year apple billion buyout beat proved controversial critic suggesting iphone maker overpaid company better known brand quality product proponent believe addition beat product apple portfolio help company earn revenue lucrative accessory market company previously compete update statement code apple spokesman tom neumayr said techcrunch rumor true offer comment matter publication cite source apple saying branding beat music could change future though streaming service remain active,jimmy iovine dr dre iovine longtime music industry executive personal friend late apple co founder steve job dr dre considerable sway industry could help secure content apple itunes business announced earlier year apple billion buyout beat proved controversial critic suggesting iphone maker overpaid company better known brand quality product proponent believe addition beat product apple portfolio help company earn revenue lucrative accessory market company previously compete update statement code apple spokesman tom neumayr said techcrunch rumor
799,"ISIL has released a second video allegedly showing the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff, according to SITE Intelligence Group.

The terrorist group had previously claimed Sotloff would be killed if the U.S. continued to attack in Iraq in a video released Aug. 19. That threat came in the same video where journalist James Foley was executed by the same group. The new video allegedly also threatens David Cawthorne Haines, a British hostage.

The Wire spoke with Joe Cleffie of SITE to gather more information about the video, which the group found on ""one of the jihadi forums.""

""We wouldn't send it out without verifying it,"" Cleffie offered. ""It's him being beheaded.""

SITE has transcribed the video on its website. In the video, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. intervention in Iraq, while the same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Foley stands behind him and states the following:

I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and [unclear] on Mosul Dam, despite our serious warnings. You, Obama, have but to gain from your actions but another American citizen. So just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people...

We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.

Below is a transcript of Sotloff's statement in the video:

I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I'm sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this time for my message:

Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life. Am I not an American citizen? You've spent billions of U.S. tax payers dollars and we've lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?

From what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. Here you are now, Obama, nearing the end of your term, and having achieving none of the above, and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing fire.

Sotloff had disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. Following his appearance in the video of Foley's beheading, Sotloff's mother, Shirley, issued a video plea to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking for her son's return.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily briefing Tuesday he had not seen the video or the reports of Sotloff's death.

He noted the U.S. military effort to rescue Sotloff and Foley in July, which failed when the hostages were not at the location they targeted.

""Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with Mr. Sotloff and his family,"" Earnest said. He added that he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity"" of the latest video.

Any new video, he said, would be ""analyzed very carefully by the U.S. government and its intelligence officials to determine its authenticity.""

According to BBC, British Prime Minister David Cameron has also condemned the video:


Just before 2 p.m., The Wire received the video showing which reportedly shows the assassination of Steven Sotloff. Please note this description of the video is graphic.

The video, which is extremely graphic in nature, was edited in a manner similar to the beheading video of James Foley. The beginning of the video shows President Obama speaking in regards to ISIL and airstrikes several weeks ago. In the next scene, Sotloff introduces himself. Sotloff appears with similarly short hair as Foley did in his video, and with a beard. He is in a similar desert area, wearing the same orange robe as Foley. The area in which this is filmed is extremely windy, unlike Foley's environment during the beheading video.

After Sotloff's brief statement, the executioner speaks and is shown putting the knife to Sotloff's neck. However, just like the Foley video, the murder scene is edited. The video shows only the knife being held up and then the decapitated body, positioned in the same manner as Sotloff's. Once again, a very short dagger, rather than a long blade, is used. The blade may be the same as in the first video. This differs greatly from traditional ISIL execution videos which have circulated the web.

The end of the video shows a  British man, David Cawthrone Haines. The executioner briefly stands next to Haines, grabbing his shirt (another long, orange robe like that of Sotloff and Foley) before releasing him and stepping to the side. The video then turns black and white, quite blurry, before ending. The executioner does not hold a knife when showing Haines, and there may be a slight murmur of background noise from others before the video ends.

Of particular note are three major edits: the black screens introducing each part of the video, the editing out of Sotloff's executioner, and the executioner's voice. The voice sounds as though it may have been manipulated after the video was shot. While the man in the video appears similar to Foley's executioner, he sounds slightly deeper and more computerized. In the first video, the voice is being used to identify the executioner, and this may be the reason for the change in this second video.

801,"In Q1 2015, we expect that Apple could very well release at least two new products – the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air. We have heard two separate rumors that the former will be launched in March and the latter will see a general Q1 2015 release, but if you’re still a little skeptical, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has basically “confirmed” it.
Kuo has been known for his pretty accurate predictions regarding Apple’s product lineup and their release timeframes, so there could be some truth in his claims. According to Kuo, he confirms that Apple will indeed be releasing the Apple Watch in March and the upcoming 12-inch MacBook Air later on in the quarter as well, but no specific dates were provided.
According to Kuo, the Apple Watch could see some supply constraint. This is due to key components of the wearable having low production yields, but Kuo notes that this is not an issue for the other components which should see high shipments in this quarter. He also expects that Apple will ship 2.5 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015 alone.
Kuo also predicts that Apple will reveal more details about the Apple Watch ahead of its release and offer up more detailed information about its battery life and when pre-orders will begin, which we guess sounds pretty probable.

802,"Seems like the President of Argentina Cristina Fernández Kirchner did not exactly save a Jewish boy from becoming a werewolf. Apparently this is what happens when a tradition and an urban legend get intertwined. The tradition does dictate that the seventh child born to an Argentine family with six consecutive children of the same sex is eligible to become the godchild of the president; and the urban myth says this child’s fate is unlucky as it is meant to become a werewolf sooner or later. So technically Lair Tawil was safe.

According to the real legend of the ‘lobizón’ (or werewolf) it is only the seventh son of the seventh son who could be potentially cursed. The Guardian reported Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda said, “The local myth of the ‘lobizón’ is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.”

The tradition of the president adopting a seventh child began in 1907 when then-president José Figueroa Alcorta, was asked by Russian immigrants Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann to become their son’s godfather. “The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

Although Isabel Perón passed the law in 1974, it’s still so that not every seventh child is eligible to become a presidential godchild; the honor is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between. The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. Kirchner has already become the presidential godmother of almost 700 children since taking office in 2007, and for all we know, she might've saved a few from becoming werewolves.",seems like president argentina cristina fern ndez kirchner exactly save jewish boy becoming werewolf apparently happens tradition urban legend get intertwined tradition dictate seventh child born argentine family six consecutive child sex eligible become godchild president urban myth say child fate unlucky meant become werewolf sooner later technically lair tawil safe according real legend lobiz n werewolf seventh son seventh son could potentially cursed guardian reported argentine historian daniel balmaceda said local myth lobiz n way connected custom began year ago every seventh son seventh daughter born argentina becomes godchild president tradition president adopting seventh child began president jos figueroa alcorta asked russian immigrant enrique brost apolonia holmann become son godfather couple wanted maintain custom czarist russia tsar said become godfather seventh son argentina president accepted although isabel per n passed law still every seventh child eligible become presidential godchild honor given seven son born consecutively daughter president godson juan per n three term office kirchner already become presidential godmother almost child since taking office know might saved becoming werewolf,president argentina cristina fern ndez kirchner exactly save jewish boy becoming werewolf apparently happens tradition urban legend get intertwined tradition dictate seventh child born argentine family six consecutive child sex eligible become godchild president urban myth say child fate unlucky meant become werewolf sooner later technically lair tawil safe according real legend lobiz n werewolf seventh son could potentially cursed guardian reported argentine historian daniel balmace
806,"Like most other places with people, Lima, Peru has a surplus of men who pass those crucial moments throughout their work day by sexually harassing women in the streets.

Everlast, the brand you had no clue was this fierce, actually did something about it.

They filmed men catcalling their own mothers. Everlast tracked down the mothers of their very scummy spawn and got them on board for a worthwhile mission: shame your son by getting him to accidentally catcall you. Everlast gave these moms makeovers, wigs, manicures, the whole thing. Then they sent these women out all dressed up like all the other desperate women who wear dresses out in public so that they could be magnets for pervy lines like “where are you going, can I come?”

Predictably, this video shows the sons saying dirty stuff to their own mothers in disguise, but it doesn’t stop there. In the typically charming way we’re all so enchanted with, one dude calls his own mom “piggy.” Another says, “tasty panties!” That’s when the most satisfying part happens. The mothers turn around for the reveal and bitch these men out. So this is one chance encounter with a lady in the street they won’t forget. The glorious leader of this effort, who is wearing fingerless Everlast driving gloves, wants the moms to slap these scoundrels, but watching them freak out is even more gratifying. Even if it isn’t real, it’s required viewing for all men with female relatives.

It could have been trite to have moms help their sons see the light by subjecting them to street harassment. It might have been corny if Everlast gave these dudes a chance to redeem themselves. But these boss women offered no such opportunity. They were on a war path to make their sons pay. In one screaming session, they express all the anger you’ve felt every time you had to deal with sex invites in the morning.

It’s a pretty genius way to turn the tables on the catcallers. At least it’s definitely more effective than issuing a friendly card explaining why it’s not polite to express interest in a stranger’s underwear. One of the guy’s explains to his mommy that it wasn’t him saying those nasty things. (It was the guy in the car.) Iron-clad alibis like this are best handled by a raging mother in heels. Freud may have already died, but now he’s literally dying over this.

809,"Masked Isis executioner Jihadi John has been injured in US led airstrikes, it has been reported.

The unidentified Briton, who savagely beheaded two British and two American hostages held captive by Islamic State, is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq, an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border, last Saturday (8 November).

American and Iraqi jets targeted the meeting of around 30 of the militant group's leaders, held in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house.

“We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them.”- The Foreign Office

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

It was originally thought that IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed in the attack, however audio recordings emerged later confirming he survived. It was not known that Jihadi John had been present at the meeting.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them.""

""We have a number of sources of information coming in. The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don't have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.""

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ""We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.""

A spokesman for US Central Command said they are also unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was reportedly rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. According to source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, commenting that it was ""the one who slaughtered the journalists.""

The extent of his injuries is not yet known, but a source said that urgent calls were made through the local mosque's loudspeakers, appealing for the town's residents to donate blood at the hospital.

After being treated at the hospital, Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and several other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelled 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

They were transferred to two captured Syrian army barracks and treated within the secure confines of the underground medical facilities. Hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, for the treatment of the injured terrorist leaders.

Jihadi John was videoed beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31.

In the most recent execution video of Mr Henning, released last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

In September, FBI Director James Comey confirmed the American bureau had identified the foreign jihadist after weeks of transatlantic intelligence efforts, but would not be releasing his identity.

A western Muslim recruit with a British accent, Jihadi John is one of the most hunted terrorists in the world, and is said to have acquired a position of seniority within the terror group for his allegiance to them. He has been made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS 'wilayat', or province.

While British converts are usually used as foot soldiers, Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and has six other British terrorists with him who serve as his bodyguards.

Aged between 28 and 31, he was named as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a rapper from Maida Vale, west London. Fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, he first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

In September, his father, Adel Abdul Bary, 54, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in relation to al-Qaida's bombing on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

810,"A Russian fisherman says the only thing that prevented a brown bear from killing him was Justin Bieber—specifically, a ringtone of Bieber's first big hit, ""Baby.""

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he'd marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind.

""There was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said, according to the Daily Mail.

The bear mauled Vorozhbitsyn's face and chest, inflicting serious cuts and bruises. He believes it probably would have killed him if his phone hadn't gone off in the nick of time, blaring ""Baby"" loudly enough to drive the bear away.

After narrowly escaping death, he also escaped a lifetime of being known as a Belieber.

""I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" the fisherman said.

The Mail quotes a bear expert as saying there wasn't anything about Bieber's music in particular that bears find offensive, but ""sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks, and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear.""

813,"Biebs may not be able to take Orlando Bloom in a bare knuckle fight but a grizzly bear poses no such problem to the pint sized pugilist

Orlando Bloom may be glad to know he is not the only one who can’t stomach Justin Bieber.

The Lord of the Rings star’s latest ally in his fallout with the pop loudmouth is a wild Russian Bear - who found the singer truly unbearable.

The beast had pounced on fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn and would have certainly have killed him .... until Igor’s phone went off and played Bieber’s hit Baby. So grisly did the mighty grizzly find the ringtone tune that it turned tail and fled back into the forest.

Recounting his terrifying experience in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, badly mauled Igor said: “I was walking to my fishing spot when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me. I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled. My granddaughter had loaded the ringtone onto my phone for a joke.”

820,"A new law in Saudi Arabia banning ‘tempting eyes’ has become the latest example of female oppression in the country.

The law, which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil, has been branded ‘stupid’ by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media, aina.org reports.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, said they ‘had the right’ to force women to cover their face.

‘The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones,’ he said.

‘We have the right to do so.’

Many commentators wondered how the word ‘tempting’ would be applied.

One unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to ‘uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup.’

‘Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble,’ they added.

Prince Naif, whose impending ascension to the Saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression, looks likely to be as intolerant as his father King Abdullah after suggesting that any Muslim should support the Committee’s new law.

‘The committee is supported by all sides,’ he said.

823,"Steve Jobs was not a man known for idle pleasantries. The late Apple CEO was infamous for his often brutal email responses to customers. When one customer emailed to say that the iPhone 4 lost all reception when the user’s hand is over the antenna, Jobs coldly responded that they should “just avoid holding it that way.” When another customer complained about Apple’s repair system, Jobs replied that “it sounds like you’re just looking for someone to get mad at other than yourself.”

Much has been made of the difference in management styles between Jobs and his successor, Tim Cook, but now another has emerged: their approach to customer queries. Whereas the former exhibited the icy bluntness exhibited above, the latter, well, actually takes it on board.

In a discussion about customer service on the r/apple subreddit, redditor lerde recently recounted how he reached out to Tim Cook via email about the “super low quality” hold music played while on hold with Apple. While Cook didn’t responded personally, “to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day,” telling lerde that Cook had indeed received the email, had looked into it personally, “and agreed that something had to be done.” Further tests were promised, and lo and behold, “the next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.”

It’s a result made all the more surprising by the sheer volume of email that Cook receives on a daily basis. Appleinsider reports that the CEO has previously told NBC that he gets “hundreds, sometimes thousands of emails from customers."" Cook added: ""This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you’re sitting at their kitchen table. … Because they care so deeply about Apple, they want to make a suggestion, or want to ask for help on something, or want to tell you how much they love the product.”

Read lerde’s full comment has been copied below:

I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).

Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done.

835,"The video comes after the beheading of journalist James Foley last month

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Tuesday 02 September 2014

Islamic State (IS) fighters have released a video which they claim shows the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff, followed by a threat that a British hostage could be next.

Sotloff, 31, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syria in August 2013 where he was working as a reporter.

Last month, he appeared at the end of a video released online by the extremist group formerly known as Isis that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

In the footage last month, Sotloff was pictured dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid landscape. IS fighters then threatened to kill Sotloff unless the US stopped air strikes against the group in Iraq.

The video distributed today begins with a short excerpt from a speech by US President Barack Obama on the fight against terror, followed by text that reads: ""A second message to America"". The IS fighter, who suggests he is the same man who killed Mr Foley, says: ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State...despite our serious warnings.""

He then appears to be behead Mr Sotloff.

The footage ends with the threat of presenting a British hostage, and issuing a warning to ""back-off and leave our people alone.""

Journalist Steven Sotloff, left, pictured in Libya in 2011 (Getty)  The White House has said it cannot confirm the authenticity of the video. Spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports, BBC New reported.

A US terrorism watchdog, the SITE Intelligence Group, first reported the video's existence.

Following Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother had appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to spare her son's life.

In a video in which she directly addressed the IS leader, she urged that her son was an ""an innocent journalist"" who had no control over US policy in the Middle East.

836,"Jermell Hasson spent his summer sleeping in a parking lot in Ferguson to join the protests over Michael Brown's shooting by police. Hasson's reward was to become racist America's favorite meme, after a doctored image of him was shared thousands of times across the internet's dark, sticky id-corners.

Riverfront Times photographer Mitch Ryals snapped an innocuous shot in September of Hasson carrying a sign with fellow protesters that read ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home,"" with the hashtags ""#blacklivesmatter"" and ""#stayhuman"":

Dumb Racists Photoshop Ferguson Protester Into Awful Viral Meme

Opponents of the protests did not take Hasson's advice. Instead, the Times reports, its image of him went viral after his sign was photoshopped to read ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store"":

Dumb Racists Photoshop Ferguson Protester Into Awful Viral Meme
EXPAND

Brown was suspected of helping to knock over a convenience store before the confrontation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson that led to the teen's death.

Riverfront Times caught up with one local man, Jim Gleason, who was apparently one of the first to share the made-up image on Facebook with the note ""You can't make this up!!!!"" (It was subsequently shared more than 28,000 times.) Gleason explained to the Times what was apparently self-evident to him and other fans of the image—that suspected robbers of convenience stores should be summarily shot:

Gleason says he is surprised and saddened by the backlash to the photo he posted because ""qualified investigators at all levels of government"" concluded that Brown robbed the convenience store before his death.

""It appears that this young man robbed a store, assaulted a police officer, and it is just surprising to me the uprising when the physical evidence seems to be overwhelmingly in support of the police officer's actions,"" Gleason says.
A handful of critics have taken to the Facebook page of Gleason's St. Louis business—a signmaking business—to express their frustrations.

Hasson called the image-doctoring a ""slander,"" but he seems to be taking it in stride. ""It shows that we are making a difference out here,"" he told the Times:

For someone who has nothing better to do with their life than photoshop a sign, it shows me that we haven't been out here since August for no reason.

838,"A wife who cut off her cheating husband’s penis sneaked back into hospital to remove it for a second time.

She allegedly flew into a rage after discovering a flirty email exchange between husband Fan Lung and his lover Zhang Hung – on her mobile phone.

The 32-year-old’s pride and joy was snipped off with a pair of scissors as he slept at his home in Shangqiu, China’s Henan province.

He was taken to hospital where he had it sewn back on. However, his fuming spouse, 30, slipped into his treatment room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

‘Someone told reception a naked man was beating up a woman outside,’ a hospital spokesman said.

‘Staff found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and his wife was taken in for treatment.

‘Then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.’

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the dad-of-five’s missing member.

They believe it may have been stolen by a stray dog or cat.

‘He is now in a stable condition but emotionally distraught,’ the spokesman added.

His wife was discharged and is under arrest for grievous bodily harm.

849,"TALLAHASSEE — A lawyer and Florida State University alum was identified by police Thursday as the gunman whose rampage left three people wounded and sent hundreds of panicked students scrambling for exits and ducking for cover.

Officers responding to 911 calls early Thursday fatally shot Myron May, a 2005 FSU grad who had moved back into the area in recent weeks,Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said.

""He refused to surrender and as a result he was shot and killed by officers,"" DeLeo said. DeLeo did not say whether May fired at police, a contention cited by a department spokesman earlier in the day.

DeLeo said May and written documents and made videos that discuss ""being targeted."" May's Facebook page includes Bible verses and links to conspiracy theories about the government reading people's minds.

""Mr. May was in a state of crisis... struggling either psychologically or emotionally,"" DeLeo said.

One victim was hospitalized in critical condition and another in good condition, a spokesperson for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare said. A third person was grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene and released.

Campus Police Chief David Perry said classes will resume Friday and the library will reopen. He promised a strong police presence. Officials canceled classes Thursday but kept the campus open and made counseling available to students and staff.

""We will get through this as a community, we will get through this as a university,"" Perry said.

More than 300 students were in Strozier Library when the shooting began at about 12:15 a.m. DeLeo said May, firing a semiautomatic .380 caliber weapon, never got past the library lobby.

Jason Derfuss, 21, said he was leaving the library when the shooter opened fire near him. Derfuss posted on Facebook pictures of a bullet and a book, Great Medieval Thinkers: John Wyclif, the bulllet had torn through. Derfuss says in his post he was near the gunman when the shooting started but never felt the shot and only discovered the damage three hours later.

""He was about 5 feet from me, but he hit my books,"" Derfuss said. ""I assumed I wasn't a target, I assumed I was fine. The truth is I was almost killed tonight and God intervened.""

""You never think something like this is going to happen to you until you have to react in that situation when someone is screaming there is a gun in the building. I ran for my life,"" said Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla. ""I ran right out the back door. My laptop and everything is still in there. It was shock. It was just instinct. You don't think about anything else, you just go.""

The shooting started shortly around 12:30 a.m. ET. About 300 to 400 students were inside the campus' main library, which is open 24 hours on weekdays, when the shooter entered with a handgun and opened fire.

University President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident but also said police did ""an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy.""

Daniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., said that when he first heard someone say, "" 'Somebody's got a gun.' I thought he was joking."" But after realizing a gunman was in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.

Three freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said they began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.

""We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,"" Anthony Coons said.

His friend Max Martin described the surreal scene.

""You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,"" Martin said. ""This is something you never want to happen.""

Nikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard ""consecutive gunshots"" that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.

""That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they saw police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,"" the freshman said.

The video below was posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis. An individual can be heard over the intercom saying ""There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,"" and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.

Students were allowed to leave the library about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown at the campus' library and in dorms.

The shooting is being investigated as a homicide and attempted murder case, said Chief Michael DeLeo of the Tallahassee Police Department.

Florida State University police issued an alert warning its 40,000 students that read: ""Dangerous Situation! Main Campus — Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.""

""If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence (it) is that the victim count was not higher,"" Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum said.

Social media immediately lit up with messages of concern and prayer requests.

Hmmm, let us explain.

According to an old Argentinian legend, the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between is liable to turn into one of the mythical creatures.

Fear was so rife in the country that families would often give up their seventh-born sons for adoption or even kill them.

In the 1920s a law was passed to counteract the legend. It offered presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday but only for Catholic families.

The Tallahassee Police Department held a news conference on Thursday morning to discuss a shooting at FSU that left three students injured. The gunman was shot and killed by officers, police said.

A Florida State University student recalls the terrifying moments when a gunman opened fire on campus on Thursday morning.

The report said the shooter, Myron May, graduated from FSU before attending Texas Tech University's law school.

May was fatally shot early Thursday morning after he shot three people at the Florida State Library, police said.

Two students were taken to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds and a third victim was treated on scene for a grazing wound, according to Tallahassee Police spokesman Dave Northway. The victims' names and conditions were not released.

A campus alert urged people to take shelter and stay away from doors and windows after the gunman opened fire inside Strozier Library just after 12 a.m., according to police.

""FSU alert dangerous situation main campus-Tallahassee,"" the alert read. ""Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.""

There were approximately 300 to 400 students inside the library at the time of the shooting. Students shoved tables and book shelves against doors to barricade themselves.

As the incident unfolded, anxious students sent tweets and text messages to loved ones.

""There's a man with a gun in the library,"" Samantha Sillick said in a text to her father. ""I love you.""

A survivor told WESH 2 News he was there during the terrifying moments when bullets began to fly.

""I heard what was unmistakably a gunshot behind me, and initially I kind of tried to rationalize it as a firecracker, but I knew exactly what it was,"" said Jason Derfuss, an FSU student. ""He gunned down another student right in front of me about 50 feet away.""



Derfuss said the gunman also fired several gunshots at him, but the books in his backpack stopped the bullets from striking his body.

Police said the officers rushed the area and shot the gunman when he refused to drop his weapon and fired at officers.

""Instead of complying with their commands, the gunman, in turn, fired a shot at the officers and they returned fire, killing the suspect,"" said Northway.

Police said the gunman acted alone, and there is no further threat to the university. Students have been allowed back into the library to retrieve their belongings.

""If there's any positive news we can take from this occurrence is that the victim count was not greater,"" said the city's Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum.

On Thursday, Gov. Rick Scott said he is praying for the victims, their families and the entire FSU community.

""I know every Seminole has a heart of a dreamer and every dreamer is resilient,"" said Scott.

FSU's new president, John Thrasher, released a statement that said in part:

""The Florida State University community is extremely saddened by the shootings that took place early this morning at Strozier Library, in the very heart of campus, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all those who have been affected.""


Thrasher also said the university will be increasing security measures and providing strong law enforcement presence on and around campus on Thursday, although the campus will be closed for the day.

FSU officials also said there will be counselors available for any students or employees in need.

The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on routine paid administrative leave.

Abigail Taunton told the AP that May had recently been staying at a guest house she owns in a rural area in the Florida Panhandle. She said police interviewed her husband, David, after the shooting.

FSU is one of the top research universities in the nation. It has about 40,000 students spread out in various campuses in the city, and is also considered one of the nation's top-ranked football teams.

865,"(CNN) -- The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.

A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.

An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

Clinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers

""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center.

Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures...nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

866,"Johannesburg - Dog fighters forced children as young as 9 to imitate real dog fights, placing bets on which child will cause the most injury through biting and scratching.

The horrific form of abuse, which shows just how damaging dog fighting can be to children, came to light early last year in Ekurhuleni, but not much has been done to help the children involved.

Inspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to see if they could do something about the problem there.

Willson said the school principal, who will not be named to protect the identity of the children, was concerned that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries.

Teachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play, while other pupils were placing bets on who would win.

The children were doing this because adults were encouraging them at weekends to take part, both in actual dog fighting and the role-play fighting.

Willson witnessed the children getting down on all fours – barking, growling, biting and scratching each other.

“They rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury,” she said.

In a video of one fight, which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example, the imitation of dogs is so authentic that if you close your eyes and listen, you will think you are listening to real dogs.

The children who were bystanders were acting out the role of dog handlers and were betting R2 to R10 on the fights that were taking place.

“The winner of the fight then gets to mate with a younger child as a reward.”

Willson was not sure if the mimicry moved on to actual copulation. She said this was in imitation of the best fighting dogs who get to be stud animals and mate with female dogs.

“It’s incredibly disturbing that young children are being forced to be involved in this,” Willson said.

She added that the children had told her that in order to stop being a “female dog”, you have to bring in a younger child to take your place.

Willson said the NSPCA had discovered, just as they had seen in other areas in which dog fighting had taken hold, that violent crime was increasing.

The NSPCA removed dogs that were involved in fighting. It also discovered cases of bestiality and other instances of horrific animal cruelty, and removed the animals from the situation.

Willson said the perpetrators involve children in the theft of the dogs, the training and in the actual fights. The children were rewarded either with money or dog food for their own dogs, which were used in fights.

She said the older the child, the less empathetic he or she was. One child had told her: “It makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful”.

The inspector said they had recorded elevated levels of aggression, bullying and theft in the children. There had been attacks on teachers, causing injuries.

“I have never seen this before,” Willson added. “I searched for examples of children being used like this internationally and came up with nothing.”

The Gauteng Department of Education said it had been made aware of these allegations early last year. “The department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention,” said spokeswoman Phumla Sekhonyane.

Willson said the NSPCA had conducted two awareness-raising workshops at the Springs school and the local police station, involving members of the community, principals, police, the Justice Department and child protection services, but while everyone had raised concern, nothing significant had been done to help the children.

A director of IRS Forensic Investigations, Glenda Paul, said the matter was of grave concern. “It is bad enough that criminals are gambling on animals tearing themselves apart for their sick pleasure, but to involve children is pure evil.”

“They are like cogs in a machine”

Teddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar said it was the first time she had ever heard of the dog-fighting role-play taking place.

“I have seen cases where children violate animals and show no remorse, but never this,” Omar said. She said it sounded to her like a situation in which children had unmet emotional needs and they needed to find ways to be in a powerful position.

“These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I’m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialised into that behaviour,” Omar said.

“Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.”

The situation needed urgent, systemic intervention, and different departments needed to get involved to stop the abuse and the children’s behaviour, she said.

“If nothing is done, this will become a breeding ground for sociopaths,” Omar said.

Dirty secret breeding organised crime

Dog fighting is defined as a sadistic contest in which two dogs, which have been specifically bred and trained to fight, are placed in a small arena to fight each other for the entertainment of spectators and for gambling purposes. It is violent organised crime that is often linked to other criminal activities.

There are three broad categories of dog fighting:

* Street-level dog fighting, which is usually linked to gang activities and during which people boast about their dog’s strength and fighting ability.

* Dog fighting as a hobby involves people buying dogs of average ability and entering them in local and regional matches.

* Professional dog fighting is the most sophisticated of the three and is sometimes conducted at national and international levels. High-stake matches featuring experienced fighting dogs with established bloodlines take place.

Many children in high-crime areas and informal settlementsare exposed to dog fighting intheir neighbourhoods, and this routine exposure to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.

It is well documented that by exposing children to such cruel brutality and repeated violence, they become desensitised and tend to perpetuate the cycle of violence, as well as promoting insensitivity towards animal suffering, an enthusiasm for violence and disrespect for the law. - Source: SPCA brochure entitled Dogfighting – SA’s dirty little secret

868,"Our 2015 calendars are about to turn over to February and there's still no confirmed launched date for the Apple Watch. As a result, speculation on when the touchscreen wearable will hit shelves is beginning to reach a fervor. Fear not, however, as Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst with a mostly reliable track record, is here to contribute to the prediction that the Apple Watch will begin shipping in March. Even more, Kuo says the much-discussed 12-inch MacBook Air will launch before the end of 2015's first quarter.

As an analyst for KGI Securities, Kuo's latest report says that before the Apple Watch's official release, Apple may announce additional details about the device (that's a big ""no duh""), including battery life specifics and when pre-orders will begin. He predicts that while components for the Apple Watch will see high shipments throughout the first quarter, initial production numbers will be low and a high customer demand will make the product hard to find. Kuo forecasts there will be 2.8 million Apple Watch shipments during the first quarter of 2015.

As for the new 12-inch MacBook Air, the analyst says the ultra-thin laptop will make its debut before the end of the current quarter, with additional information saying that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, has already begun increasing production. As a brand new entry to the MacBook Air line, the 12-inch model has long been suggested to feature a Retina display and an even thinner design, while recent rumors have pegged the notebook to ship with only a headphone jack and a single new reversible USB Type-C connector that will be used for charging.

A release date for the new MacBook Air within the current quarter definitely seems soon, but an alleged leak of the laptop's display only days ago could back up Kuo's claim of production having already begun. As for his prediction of a March release for the Apple Watch, that seems like a pretty safe bet, since Apple's own website says the device is ""coming early 2015."" We'll just have to wait to see if the wearable actually ships that month, of if that's just when pre-orders will begin.

875,"A source familiar with the matter, has told Benzinga that China's Lenovo Group Limited (OTC: LNVGY) could make an offer to acquire Canadian mobile communications company, BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY), as early as this week.

The source said Lenovo's first offer would be $15.00 per share, with a deal ultimately getting done around $18.00 per share.

Lenovo's CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013, that BlackBerry (still known as Research in Motion at that time) was one of many possible opportunities for the company. BlackBerry played down the comment.

Later that year, the Canadian government reportedly blocked a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo, due to national security concerns.

Lenovo announced Wednesday, the creation of a new company focused on internet-based smart devices, to be launched on April 1, 2015. The company will operate under a separate name and brand.

A spokesperson for BlackBerry told Benzinga on Saturday, the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. A Lenovo spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

BlackBerry closed Friday at $9.49, a gain of 2 percent.

876,"Even bears can’t stand Justin Bieber’s music.

A fisherman in Russia was being attacked by a brown bear and escaped death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and sent the beast fleeing into the forest.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn was heading to a local fishing spot in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic when the Bieber-hating bear suddenly appeared and pounced on him, Central European News reports.

The 42-year-old was saved when Bieber’s popular hit song “Baby” started playing on his phone.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said.

“I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste, but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.”

Wildlife experts said it was the music’s volume that scared the bear away — not the quality of the music.

“Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” an expert told Central European News.

878,"STOCKHOLM — Speaking via Google Hangout to officials in Sweden last week, former NSA Contractor Edward Snowden dropped a bag of coal on his former employers by revealing the hugely popular “Elf on a Shelf” trend is actually an intelligence gathering operation originating with and run by the National Security Agency.

“It actually started out as a joke,” Snowden said in his speech. “Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption ‘I’m watching you,’ and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.”

Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?

“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

“The elves have basic mobility, which isn’t a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,” Snowden added, “it’s just assumed to be part of the game.”

Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.

“We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,” Snowden said. “Especially for Tailored Access Operations.”

In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.

“The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,” journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email.  “They can tell things about people’s health — cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”

Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.

“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.

“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”",stockholm speaking via google hangout official sweden last week former nsa contractor edward snowden dropped bag coal former employer revealing hugely popular elf shelf trend actually intelligence gathering operation originating run national security agency actually started joke snowden said speech someone photocopied picture elf caption watching kept moving cubicle cubicle snowden said point occurred someone people paranoid nsa staff would play game would happen civilian nsa agent inside practically every home child snowden said elf basic mobility problem one show someplace unexpected snowden added assumed part game adorable snoop nsa gained access million tax return bank statement year old boy unwrapping wrapping present day ahead christmas would flag kid later recruitment intelligence community snowden said especially tailored access operation addition nsa uncovered trove data personal life million american source confirmed nsa incorporated advanced sensor thing uncover kind information journalist glenn greenwald told duffel blog email tell thing people health cancer heart disease liver disease know naughty really naughty thing even extensive online snooping provide dildo vibrator chain thing stashed closet bed source told reporter previously inaccessible government leading intelligence agency owner paid cash least want know privacy advocate settled moved guess blackmail elf accumulated petabyte evidence pretty much everybody snowden said believe perverse thing people right front thing snowden concluded elfmonitor highly sought duty assignment,nsa uncovered trove of data personal life million american source confirmed nsa incorporated advanced sensor thing uncover kind information journalist glenn greenwald told duffel blog email tell thing people health cancer heart disease liver disease know naughty really naughty thing even extensive online snooping provide dildo vibrator chain thing stashed closet bed source told reporter previously inaccessible government leading intelligence agency owner paid cash least want know privacy advocate settled moved guess blackmail elf accumulated peta
881,"Hewlett-Packard is planning to split itself into two separate businesses, The Wall Street Journal is reporting.

Sources tell the WSJ that HP will split its personal-computer and printer segments from its corporate hardware and services business.

The announcement could come as early as Monday, the sources said.

The company reorganized itself in 2012 under CEO Meg Whitman. That move combined its computer and printer businesses.

The PC and computer segment is massive for HP. For the first six months this year, it reported $27.8 billion in revenue. That's about three times the size of HP's next biggest unit, the Enterprise Group, which makes servers, storage, and network hardware.

Under the new split, Whitman would be chairman of the computer and printer business, and CEO of a separate Enterprise Group, according to one of the sources. Patricia Russo, who sits on HP's board, would be chairman of the enterprise company. The printer and PC operation would be led by Dion Weisler, a current exec in that division.

Whitman has said since 2012 that fixing the supply chain is one of HP's biggest priorities to get the company back on track in terms of revenues and profits. HP reported a beat on revenue for its third quarter, and its profits were right in line.

This isn't the first time HP has been toying with the idea of strategic moves. For almost a year it has contemplated merging with EMC to create what would be one of the biggest enterprise companies in the world. But talks apparently fell through, The WSJ reported.

And HP isn't the only company that sees benefit in splitting itself to create a more-focused company. eBay announced last week that it was spinning off PayPal into a separate business starting next year.

HP declined to comment.

884,"ISIS is trying to sell the remains of beheaded journalist James Foley to his parents or the US government for $1 million, according to a new report.

A source who is a middleman contacted by ISIS to broker the deal told BuzzFeed that ISIS is trying to present it as an act of mercy for the family and a “humanity case,” it was reported.

James Foley was the first US hostage to be beheaded by an ISIS militant in a graphic video recording.

JAMES FOLEY BEHEADED

FAILED RAID TO SAVE JAMES FOLEY

Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism.

The Islamic fundamentalist group, which has overrun large sections of Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of people in the process, had been financing its military by selling oil produced by the wells in the areas it has captured and by collecting ransom from the governments of its non-American hostages.

But with the price of crude oil now plummeting and the US and Britain standing firmly by their policy to not pay ransoms, ISIS — also known as the Islamic State — devised the plan to sell the corpse.

It is offering his family a DNA sample to prove that the body it is holding really is his.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” the source told Buzzfeed. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

The source said that he is concerned the US will stop the deal even if the family wants it, because the government nixed a ransom demand before Foley’s death.",isi trying sell remains beheaded journalist james foley parent u government million according new report source middleman contacted isi broker deal told buzzfeed isi trying present act mercy family humanity case reported james foley first u hostage beheaded isi militant graphic video recording james foley beheaded failed raid save james foley since august terrorist group overtaking large swathe syria iraq beheaded two american briton similar display barbarism islamic fundamentalist group overrun large section iraq syria killing thousand people process financing military selling oil produced well area captured collecting ransom government non american hostage isi tip rape punish sex slave australian caught fighting isi face hanging price crude oil plummeting u britain standing firmly policy pay ransom isi also known islamic state devised plan sell corpse offering family dna sample prove body holding really ask million send dna turkey want money first source told buzzfeed give dna without money source said concerned u stop deal even family want government nixed ransom demand foley death,isi militant graphic video recording james foley beheaded failed raid save james foley since august terrorist group overtaking large swathe syria iraq beheaded two american briton similar display barbarism islamic fundamentalist group overrun large section iraq syria killing thousand people process financing military selling oil produced well area captured collecting ransom government non american hostage isi tip rape punish sex slave australian caught
889,"Tampa, Florida -- Jasmine Tridevil had made international headlines by posting pictures and videos claiming she got a third breast implanted into the center of her chest.

The Tampa massage therapist even spoke with 10 News reporter Charles Billi and said it was legit.

And indeed, from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevil's claims. Snopes.com, the urban legends website, took an in-depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax.

And now perhaps the final piece of evidence: 10 News has received an an incident report from Tampa International Airport, where earlier this month Tridevil (real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler) reported her baggage had been stolen.

The luggage was eventually recovered and two people were arrested for stealing several bags off of the airport conveyor belts. When Tridevil went to retrieve her recovered items, a property receipt was written that listed the contents contained within:

890,"Three Afghan soldiers who disappeared while on a training exercise in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, were apprehended Monday after trying to cross the border into Canada, WCVB and NBC News report.

The three men, identified as Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar, were taken into custody at the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/U.S. border crossing near Niagara Falls, according to WCVB.

Below, more on the missing soldiers from the AP:

Military officials said the Afghan soldiers had been participating in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise at Joint Base Cape Cod. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen Saturday at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis during an off day for the program.

The soldiers were reported missing by base security personnel Saturday night. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

It's not unusual for foreign military members to go missing when they are in the U.S. for training missions. Earlier this month, two Afghan police taking part in a training mission at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia disappeared. They were later found in Georgetown.

On Monday, Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said the 14 Afghans taking part in the Cape Cod military exercise were ""thoroughly vetted"" prior to coming to the U.S., so officials do not believe they are a threat.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., is scheduled to wrap up Wednesday.

893,"Leading invertebrate researcher says ""a hoax is an understatement"" of photograph appearing to show a colossal crustacean basking off the Kent coastline

A fifty-foot crab dwelling somewhere off the English coast is a thing of nightmares.

The shadowy figure of a colossal crustacean, apparently spotted in the murky waters of Whistable, in Kent, dwarfs boats and cars on the pier it lurks besides.

A satellite picture of the so-called crab, aptly dubbed ‘Crabzilla’, has gone viral after first surfacing on Weird Whitstable, a website for the supernatural curated by illustrator Quinton Winter, which deals in “phantoms, mysteries, tall tales, and artefacts”.

The creature is depicted in the coastal town’s harbour, which is a popular spot for children to go crabbing in the summer.

But those suffering from ostraconophobia (that’s fear of shellfish to you and me) needn’t be left gasping for air, because invertebrate expert Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum in London has branded the photo a hoax.

""I had a good giggle about it - it's ridiculous,"" he said, adding that it ""is definitely not real.""

Here's why:

The largest crabs in the world are thought to be Japanese spider crabs - also known as Macrocheira kaempferi - which can grow to the size of a small car with an impressive leg span of up to twelve feet. However, these crabs live in deep, cold water around Japan and are a completely different shape.

2. Another huge crab with a more similar shape to the one in the picture is the Tasmanian giant crab, also known as Pseudocarcinus gigas. These are the world's heaviest crabs but they reside in the southern waters of Australia at depths of 20-820 metres.

3. Mr Clark did not think that the crab was a representation of Cancer pagurus, also known as the edible crab, either because of a slightly different shape. And anyway, these tend to only grow to a maximum of 30 centimetres.

4. Instead, he said that the crab looked more to him like a shore crab (Carcinus maenas) - cleverly Photoshopped on to a satellite image. ""A hoax is an understatement. A shore crab gets up to two inches - if you're lucky!"" he said.

5.

894,"In a recent thread on Reddit, one Apple customer describes an experience in which he effected change in Apple's daily operations, specifically as it pertains to ""on hold"" music, after contacting CEO Tim Cook via email.

Since the days of Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executives have been famously open to customer suggestions, complaints and praise, often engaging with the public via work email accounts. As noted by TUAW, that tradition appears to carry on with current CEO Tim Cook.

According to one account shared on Reddit — in response to an earlier post on efforts taken by Apple's Maps team to correct erroneous address data — a customer was reportedly able to induce change in the quality of on hold music used by Apple's call center.

I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).

Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.

The next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.

Cook is known to be just as open to criticism . During an interview with NBC's Brian Williams in 2012, Cook admitted he routinely receives hundreds of emails from customers every day.

""I get hundreds, and some days thousands of emails from customers. This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you're sitting at their kitchen table,"" Cook said at the time. ""Because they care so deeply about Apple, they want to make a suggestion, or want to ask for help on something, or want to tell you how much they love the product.""",recent thread reddit one apple customer describes experience effected change apple daily operation specifically pertains hold music contacting ceo tim cook via email since day steve job apple chief executive famously open customer suggestion complaint praise often engaging public via work email account noted tuaw tradition appears carry current ceo tim cook according one account shared reddit response earlier post effort taken apple map team correct erroneous address data customer reportedly able induce change quality hold music used apple call center sent tim email quality music hold apple super low quality therefore upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion really aggravated hold minute something simple iphone turn needed set repair country apple store send another country much surprise lady cupertino called next day saying received concerning email tim ugly distortion hold music phone tim tested agreed something done assured hold music would tested make sure sounded pleasant type phone connection next time called apple hold music indeed pleasant cook known open criticism interview nbc brian williams cook admitted routinely receives hundred email customer every day get hundred day thousand email customer privilege talk sitting kitchen table cook said time care deeply apple want make suggestion want ask help something want tell much love product,sounded like pure distortion really aggravated hold minute something simple iphone turn needed set repair country apple store send another country much surprise lady cupertino called next day saying received concerning email tim ugly distortion hold music phone tim tested agreed something done assured hold music would tested make sure sounded pleasant type phone connection next time called apple hold music indeed pleasant cook known open criticism interview nbc brian williams cook admitted routinely receive hundred email customer every day get hundred day thousand email customer privilege talk sitting kitchen table
895,"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband’s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on — and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.

Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife’s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.

The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng — who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm — came across the saucy exchange and snapped.

The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.

Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.

But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.

A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesman said. “He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung’s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.

Lung’s side chick — Zhang Hung, 21 — said she’s OK with her man not being able to have more children.

896,"A South Korean woman who was attacked by her robot vacuum cleaner while she slept had to be rescued by emergency services.

The woman was taking a nap on the floor of her house in the city of Changwon when the machine turned on her. The automatic vacuum cleaner, which she had programmed to clean the room around her, apparently mistook her hair for dust and sucked it up, the Korea Bizwire website reports.

Unable to escape, she was forced to call the local fire department with what South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun described as a ""desperate rescue plea"", according to the The Guardian.

The 52-year old woman, whose name has not been made public, was eventually extracated from the machine and suffered only minor injuries.

But while she escaped relatively lightly, the incident could provide ""a peek into a dystopian future in which supposedly benign robots turn against their human masters"", suggests the Guardian.

There is a growing market for consumer robots, with the Roomba remote control vacuum cleaner by iRobot selling more than ten million units since it debuted in 2002.

Korea Biz Wire points out that people in Korean and Japan, where its common to sit, sleep and eat on the floor, should ""exercise caution"" around their household robots. ·",south korean woman attacked robot vacuum cleaner slept rescued emergency service woman taking nap floor house city changwon machine turned automatic vacuum cleaner programmed clean room around apparently mistook hair dust sucked korea bizwire website report unable escape forced call local fire department south korean newspaper kyunghyang shinmun described desperate rescue plea according guardian year old woman whose name made public eventually extracated machine suffered minor injury escaped relatively lightly incident could provide peek dystopian future supposedly benign robot turn human master suggests guardian growing market consumer robot roomba remote control vacuum cleaner irobot selling ten million unit since debuted korea biz wire point people korean japan common sit sleep eat floor exercise caution around household robot,woman attacked robot vacuum cleaner slept rescued emergency service woman taking nap floor house city changwon machine turned automatic vacuum cleaner programmed clean room around apparently mistook hair dust sucked korea bizwire website report unable escape forced call local fire department south korean newspaper kyunghyang shinmun described desperate rescue plea according guardian year old woman whose name made public eventually extracated machine suffered minor injury escaped relatively lightly incident could provide peek dystopian future
897,"So here's the latest in wild internet rumors.

Everyone thinks that the President of Argentina Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a young Jewish man in order to stop him from turning into a werewolf. The story was reported by The Independent and others.

Well, the story's kind of true — Fernández de Kirchner did adopt the young man as her godson — but not to keep him from turning into a werewolf.

There's an old Argentinian legend that a seventh child will turn into ""el lobizon"" — aka a werewolf — after his 13th birthday, and then terrorize the Argentinian countryside at night whenever there's a full moon, as reported by the Independent. In the 19th century, parents were reportedly so spooked by ""el lobizon"" that they started abandoning and murdering their 7th children.

Around the same time, in the early 20th century, another tradition involving a seventh child came to be. Argentinian presidents started adopting the seventh child born in a family as godchildren.

Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía. pic.twitter.com/18eNPR5kXv

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

Over the last few days, sources have been reporting that this Argentinian custom was adopted as a response to the murder and abandonment of these ""el lobizon"" children.

However, others like the Guardian are debunking this. Reportedly, the godchild custom goes back all the way to 1907 when Russian emigrés asked the then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become the godfather to their seventh son, reports the Guardian.

""The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told The Guardian.

So what exactly what special about Iair Tawil's case? Traditionally, the seventh son or daughter could only become a godchild of the Argentinian president if he or she was Christian. But Tawil was the first Jewish young man to do so — making it a tweet-worthy affair.

Fernández has become the president godmother to roughly 700 children since she took office in 2007, reports The Guardian.

898,"The woman was reportedly furious she had not been told of his condition

An Indian bride has reportedly swapped her groom for a wedding guest mid-ceremony after her fiancé had an epileptic seizure.

Jugal Kishore, 25, reportedly fell to the ground during the traditional exchange of “varmala” flower garlands in the northern town of Rampur.

His illness was a shock to his wife-to-be, 23-year-old Indira, who was apparently furious that she and her family had not been told of Mr Kishore’s epilepsy.

Instead of calling the wedding off, she quickly chose wedding guest Harpal Singh, her sister’s brother-in-law, to replace him.

Casually dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, he accepted, the Times of India reported.

After the swap, the wedding ceremony continued as planned until Mr Kishore returned from hospital.

Shocked at returning to his own wedding to find his fiancée celebrating her marriage to someone else, he and his relatives reportedly pleaded with Indira to reverse her decision.

When diplomacy failed, the family allegedly resorted to violence and entered into a brawl involving plates and cutlery.

Mr Kishore’s family later filed a complaint at the local Milak police station but withdrew it after older relatives intervened.

RP Solanki, an official at the station, told the Times of India two wedding guests were briefly arrested.

“Both families have amicably resolved the matter,” he added.

“The complaints have been withdrawn.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the Journal said in a report on its web site that cited people familiar with the matter. The division would be made through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year, according to the report.

905,"The world waits with baited breath for more details about the Apple Watch, which should be revealed at a special event in San Francisco next Monday. But Tim Cook is just as anxious as we are to get this party started, and he teased some details in a trip to Germany.

As reported by 9to5Mac, Cook visited the flagship Apple Store in Berlin, and confirmed to the employees there that the Apple Watch would go on sale in Germany during the month of April. Cook had already confirmed an April launch in the United States during a recent earnings call, so this might mean the watch will launch globally all at once, or that the United States will get it first, followed by Germany later in the month.

Apple has been getting faster about rolling out products, and credited the “fastest rollout ever” of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus as part of its record-breaking success in Q1 2015. 9to5Mac points out that Apple is already promoting the Apple Watch in China, so we wouldn’t be surprised if the watch launches there in April too.

Cook also boasted to employees that “a whole ton of announcements are coming shortly about all of the apps,” according to 9to5Mac’s report. Starwood Hotels was specifically highlighted at the watch’s unveiling last September, and Cook also mentioned Panera Bread (an Apple Pay partner) and Salesforce. Apple has a tradition of inviting third-party app makers on stage to demonstrate, so we can’t wait to see what they’ve been cooking up with the WatchKit SDK.

We’re wrapping up our own round of interviews with Apple Watch devs that will go live on Macworld later this week. And of course we will be live-blogging and live-tweeting direct from the event on Monday, beginning at 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern.

910,"The ring little Aiden brought to school may not have been the true ring of power, but it had enough controversy to get him suspended from a Kermit, Texas, school.

Tolkien lore led a Texas boy to suspension after he brought his “one ring” to school.

Kermit Elementary School officials called it a threat when the 9-year-old boy, Aiden Steward, in a playful act of make-believe, told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional Middle Earth’s Mount Doom.

“It sounded unbelievable,” the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the Daily News. He insists his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”

The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies” days earlier, inspiring Aiden’s imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all.

“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Steward said.

Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friend's head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins, who stole Gollum’s ""precious"" in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings.”

“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” the boy's father later wrote in an email. ""If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.""

Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth-grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, who first reported Aiden’s troubles Friday.

The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, but it’s been nothing but headaches for Aiden. He’s already been suspended three times this school year.

Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school: ""The Big Book of Knowledge.""

“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Steward said.

But the teacher learned the popular children’s encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy, depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration, he explained.

911,"When you’re a company the size of Apple (whose co-founder Steve Jobs famously made comments about how it’s not the job of users to know what they want) you’d be forgiven for thinking they don’t listen to the little guy.

Over the weekend, a story popped up on Reddit, however, revealing how one user supposedly convinced Tim Cook to change Apple’s on-hold music — telling him that it sounded distorted and therefore surprisingly un-Apple-like in its lack of quality. Cook apparently listened and – hey presto! – people dialling into Apple now get better-sounding hold music while they wait.

The full post can be read below:

“I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple.

Like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook’s email ((sorry, you need Javascript to see this e-mail address)) is public and there are multiple stories of him responding to those who email him. During his 2013 address at Auburn University, Cook commented that: “I receive hundreds of e-mails from customers every day, and I read them all.”

Apparently he has quite the efficient (team of?) personal assistant(s) to turn that reading into actions, as well.

912,"At CES 2015 event scheduled between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9, a potential company named Standzout will be showcasing its prototype of the Apple Watch accessory. The accessory in focus is the ""Bandstand Apple Watch dock."" The aforesaid company calls it the first great Apple Watch accessory ever.

The dock apparently makes use of an ""induction charging plate to power the gadget"" and by doing so, it holds the smartwatch in place. In addition, there are two USB ports housed on the device to enable the user to charge other devices like Apple iPhones and iPads, notes Phone Arena. Interested readers can check out the Bandstand Apple Watch dock prototype from Gigaom.

When it comes to Apple Watch release date, reports state that the Cupertino-headquartered company might launch its gadget on Valentine's Day. Meanwhile, the sales predictions for the Apple Watch are as high as 30 million units and the demand is assumed to grow further, according to the same site. In contrast to other smartwatches available in the market, Apple will reportedly be marketing the Watch as a fashion accessory than a tech gear.

When it comes to key features of the Apple Watch, the company is believed to be working on two different models, namely 38 mm and 42 mm versions of the smartwatch. Moreover, the gadget with high focus on fashion will be offered in six different casing options. In addition, the smartwatch's band can reportedly be interchanged as required. As far as the pricing details go, the base variant of the Apple Watch i.e. the sports model will reportedly be priced at $349. But then, the high-end variants especially the solid gold/diamond model will go as high as several thousand dollars, says MacRumors.

Moving on to the higher-end Apple Watch, Apple is planning to release a $30,150 priced model of the smartwatch, adorned in diamonds and sapphire. The sapphire and diamond-clad gadget will reportedly come with eight rows of ""high-grade 15 carat diamonds"" and it is considered to be the ""luxury edition"" of the smartwatch.

914,"Nope. Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf – despite what you may have read in multiple news reports.

Over the past few days, the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet, picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz, Buzzfeed, The Independent and The Huffington Post.

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson.

In her Twitter account, Kirchner described Tawil, 21, as “completely sweet” and lit Hanukkah candles with his family.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

But according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. “The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said.

That custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigrés from south-eastern Russia asked then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian.

“The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

The practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Perón, the widow of Argentina’s political strongman General Juan Perón, once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office. As Argentina’s first woman president, Mrs Perón extended the benefit to seventh daughters as well.“The unconnected myth of the lobizón began among Argentina’s “gauchos,” the cowboys of Argentina’s vast cattle-raising Pampas, adapted from the older European werewolf legends,” said Balmaceda.In the Argentinian version, the lobizón transforms into a mixture of pig and dog every Tuesday and Friday night – not just once every full moon. Unlikely other werewolves of myth, the lobizón transmits its curse not through its bite but by passing between the legs of its unfortunate victims.

In Catholic Argentina, large familes are not uncommon: over 120,000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god-children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between.

The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president, Carlos Menem, who had 1,136 during the 1990s. Fernández has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year, she set another precedent, by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild.",nope argentina president cristina fern ndez de kirchner become godmother jewish baby stop becoming werewolf despite may read multiple news report past day story reported unquestioningly reported across echo chamber internet picked news organisation around world including haaretz buzzfeed independent huffington post like good urban myth article based grain truth tradition seventh son daughter born argentine family eligible become godson daughter president month honour bestowed christian baby wednesday iair tawil baby strapping year old son rabbi became country first jewish presidential godson twitter account kirchner described tawil completely sweet lit hanukkah candle family ten raz n trajeron de regalo un candelabro de israel pidieron que encendiera la vela pic twitter com dvwewmzera yo lo sab pero su visita coincid con la celebraci n de hanukkah el pap dec que era una casualidad pic twitter com e gew somehow story became entangled ancient legend lobiz n argentina equivalent european werewolf according version myth seventh son seventh son particularly prone fall victim curse evidently chance meeting latin american president colourful myth good fact check proved irresistible confirming number stereotype erratic behaviour national leader continent magical realism according argentine historian daniel balmaceda link two tradition local myth lobiz n way connected custom began year ago every seventh son seventh daughter born argentina becomes godchild president said custom began enrique brost apolonia holmann volga german emigr south eastern russia asked president jos figueroa alcorta become godfather seventh son said historian couple wanted maintain custom czarist russia tsar said become godfather seventh son argentina president accepted practice soon became tradition passed law isabel per n widow argentina political strongman general juan per n succeeded presidential seat death office argentina first woman president mr per n extended benefit seventh daughter well unconnected myth lobiz n began among argentina gaucho cowboy argentina vast cattle raising pampas adapted older european werewolf legend said balmaceda argentinian version lobiz n transforms mixture pig dog every tuesday friday night every full moon unlikely werewolf myth lobiz n transmits curse bite passing leg unfortunate victim catholic argentina large familes uncommon family seven child last count qualify become presidential god child honour given seven son born consecutively daughter president godson juan per n three term office followed another peronist former president carlos menem fern ndez become presidential godmother child since taking office earlier year set another precedent making daughter lesbian couple first presidential godchild,argentina president cristina fern ndez de kirchner become godmother jewish baby stop becoming werewolf despite may read multiple news report past day story reported unquestioningly reported across echo chamber internet picked news organisation around world including haaretz buzzfeed independent huffington post like good urban myth article based grain truth tradition tawil baby strapping year old son rabbi became country first jewish presidential godson twitter account kirchner described tawil

918,"Mittens the cat has both male and female genitalia.

The Canadian kitty, who lives with its owner in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, will need surgery to cure its bowel and urinary problems as a result of its dual gender, CBC reports.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy took Mittens in when her daughter brought it home, thinking it was a stray. In October, Mittens was rushed to a vet, who gave the surprising news. Clarke-Murphy said her first response was, ""Did I just hear you right?""

Since gender assignment surgery is more a medical need than a cosmetic one, the initial question was, which gender should Mittens be?

Clarke-Murphy said she'd rather have a female cat, but she'll follow the veterinarian's recommendation to make Mittens a male.

""They're the ones who know what they're doing. I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts,"" she said. ""I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.""

Mittens will need to be both spayed and neutered before the $1,500 reconstructive surgery. Good luck, Mittens!

Cats with two genders may be uncommon, but they're not unheard of, Liverpool Echo reports. Late last year, a couple in Liverpool was shocked to find that their little white princess, Twinkle, was also a little white prince.

Twinkle's vet recommended that the male parts be removed, and made it so. The feline is reportedly doing well -- alongside her brother Socks -- after her gender assignment surgery.

923,"President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner adopted Yair Tawil as her godson, due to an Argentine folktale that says the seventh born son in a family will turn into a werewolf, and eat unbaptized babies.

Argentina's president has adopted a young Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil was adopted in a ceremony which took place because of Argentinian folklore, reports the Independent.

He is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the practice only applied to Catholics until 2009.

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared ""el lobison"".

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

Legend has it that the lobison feeds on unbaptized babies.

Although the story may now seem fanciful, fear of the werewolf-like creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies.

To stop the practice happening the Argentine president began adopting babies.

Any family now which has seven sons or daughters get the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship, reports the Independent.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner described the adoption as a ""magical moment"" and called the Tawils a ""marvelous family"".",president cristina fernandez de kirchhner adopted yair tawil godson due argentine folktale say seventh born son family turn werewolf eat unbaptized baby argentina president adopted young jewish boy godson stop turning werewolf yair tawil adopted ceremony took place argentinian folklore report independent first jewish boy adopted practice applied catholic according tradition country seventh son born family turn werewolf feared el lobison creature show true nature first friday boy th birthday turning teenager demon midnight every full moon legend lobison feed unbaptized baby although story may seem fanciful fear werewolf like creature widespread th century argentina family even murdered baby stop practice happening argentine president began adopting baby family seven son daughter get president official godparent gold medal full educational scholarship report independent president cristina fernandez de kirchhner described adoption magical moment called tawils marvelous family,president cristina fernandez de kirchhner adopted yair tawil godson due argentine folktale say seventh born son family turn werewolf eat unbaptized baby argentina president adopted young jewish boy godson stop turning werewolf yair tawil adopted ceremony took place argentinian folklore report independent first jewish boy adopted practice applied catholic according tradition country seventh born son family turn werewolf eat unbaptized baby
925,"The tubby dictator has become hooked on Emmental - and appeared on TV with a swollen face and a limp at a recent ­ceremony in the capital Pyongyang

Portly despot Kim Jong-un is absolutely crackers – about Swiss cheese.

The tubby North Korean dictator has become hooked on Emmental and has gorged on so much that he has ballooned in size and is now walking with a limp.

The 31-year-old fell in love with the holey treat when he was a student in Switzerland.

He now imports it for his own consumption, while millions of his citizens starve.

A gloomy Jong-un appeared on TV with a swollen face and a limp at a recent ­ceremony in the capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder Kim Il-sung.

It prompted dissidents who have fled the closed nation to reveal he is in poor health due to his increasing weight.

Reuters   Ill? Dissidents who have left the country reveal he is in poor health

They believe Jong-un stuffs himself to look like his grandfather.

Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said: “North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.

""There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.”

Jong-un even sent envoys to France to try and enrol North Korean cooks on cheese making courses.

The director of National Dairy Industry College, Veronique Drouet, said the Korean request was politely but firmly declined.

An American was arrested by South Korean marines as he tried to swim up a river into North Korea. The man, in his 20s or 30s, was found clinging to the bank suffering from exhaustion.

929,"(WASHINGTON, DC) – In the boldest takeover of Presidential authority in history, Barack Obama ordered the Federal Reserve to adopt the euro beginning October 1, 2015, the start of the next fiscal year. The US will soon share the single monetary system used by 18 European Union member states, including Greece, France, Germany, and Slovakia.

The surprise announcement resulted from secret overseas deals between Obama, foreign finance ministers and the Federal Reserve System. “This step forward,” announced Obama, “will make it easier for Americans and Wall Street to compare prices, stabilize the economy, and set us up to again become leaders on the world economic stage.” The President revealed the changeover during the worldwide economic summit held in Beijing, where alongside Chinese premier Li Keqiang, he worked out a climate accord agreement, also developed in secrecy.

Criticism has been swift and severe. “Obama’s given up entirely on our US economy after single-handedly destroying it,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX 8th District), Chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

“It’s like breaking all the toys in the toybox and then saying I don’t want to play with those broken products anymore,” said former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. “This is the most abusive power grab witnessed on the worldwide stage. He needs to consider staying over in China while he’s there,” she added.

To help with the conversion to the euro, a new whitehouse.gov website will launch in early 2015, complete with downloadable conversion calculators and apps. Printable vouchers will be provided for discounts toward government manufactured cash registers. A children’s website featuring ‘Yuri the Happy Euro‘ will help prepare youngsters for the new system.

For the first 3 months of the conversion, euro notes and coins will circulate jointly with US currency, owing to overlap with the 2015 holiday season. “We don’t want to add any extra stress to an already hectic time of year,” said the President. “My economic team predicts everything will go smoothly, and holiday shopping should be stronger than ever.”

Many unanswered questions remain. Will vendors take advantage of the new system to gouge consumers? What about ATMs? Will small businesses who can’t afford to make the changeover right away close up shop and further weaken an increasingly unstable Obama economy?

“I think it’s a good idea, said Washington DC shop owner Vonda Miller. “I spend too much time counting pennies all day long making change. They tell me my taxes will be easier to do, so I’m for whatever the President wants.”

935,"Jan Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat doctor took a selfie while the comic was under sedation and began an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords before the 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest, CNN reported Tuesday.

A staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic was the one who told investigators about the picture-taking, according to a source CNN described as close to the death investigation. The physician has not been identified.
The ENT doctor's alleged presence in the operating room was first reported last week by the New York Daily News, with sources telling the New York Times that he wasn't authorized to be there.

The ""spur-of-the-moment"" biopsy caused Rivers' vocal cords to seize up in what's called a laryngospasm, the Daily News source said.
The clinic had countered the biopsy allegation last Wednesday, saying in a statement that a ""biopsy of vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" adding that although ""monitored"" or ""light to moderate"" sedation occurred at the clinic, general anesthesia was never administered. The statement referred to clinic procedures in general, not the Rivers case specifically.
Rivers was rushed from the Upper East Side clinic to Manhattan's Mt. Sinai Hospital on Aug. 28 after she reportedly stopped breathing during the outpatient procedure, an upper endoscopy, in which a tiny camera was inserted in her throat to examine that part of the digestive system.

She did not regain consciousness after arriving at the hospital, and daughter Melissa Rivers had her taken off life support on Sept. 4.
Dr. Lawrence B. Cohen, who according to the CNN source did the upper endoscopy, stepped down last week as Yorkville medical director and was no longer performing procedures there, a clinic spokeswoman said.

The New York State Department of Health has said it is investigating.

937,"Murderous cult figurehead Charles Manson, now 80 and in prison for life, received a marriage license back in November so that he could tie the knot with Afton ""Star"" Elaine Burton, 26, who comes off in interviews like another crazed admirer. She might be more than that, though: their license has lapsed without a wedding, and one journalist claims it's because Manson got wise to Star's alleged plan to acquire his corpse and put it on public display for money. Holy shit, really? Here's what we know.

Daniel Simone, who's working on a book about Manson, told Page Six that Star Burton and her associate, Craig ""Gray Wolf"" Hammond, have been scheming for two years to open a Lenin's Tomb-style attraction in California, with the madman's body on view in a glass case.

When the two asked Manson to sign his body over to them, Simone says, he wouldn't give a definitive answer. He just led them on so they'd keep bringing him ""toiletries and other items"" in prison. The marriage plot was the next step, according to Simone, an attempt to ensure Star would get Manson's remains after his death.

""There's certain things next of kin can do,"" she told the AP last November, saying she wanted to work on Manson's case and the marriage would give her access to confidential information. She didn't mention the body.

And now Manson has let their 90-day marriage certificate lapse.

""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool,"" Simone claims, adding that Manson thinks Burton's plan for his body is stupid because ""he feels he will never die."" Now Manson allegedly doesn't want to get married at all.

That's not what Burton and Hammond's website claims, though: They say Manson plans to renew the license, and the wedding was only postponed ""due to an unexpected interruption in logistics.""

But who's playing whom, here? Back in 2013, when Burton first announced her engagement to Manson in Rolling Stone, Manson dismissed her:

He snorts. ""Oh, that,"" he says. ""That's a bunch of garbage. You know that, man. That's trash. We're just playing that for public consumption.""
Manson also called ""Star"" his ""baby on the floor,"" implying that he was manipulating her like he did the other women in his murderous Family. Like them, she shaved her head and carved an x into her forehead at his request.

""We started all over with this one. The other ones know it all now. I don't need to say anything.""

He doesn't come off like the one being ""played for a fool"" in that scenario. And Burton's claim that Manson thinks he can never die doesn't square with what Manson himself told Rolling Stone contributor Eric Hedegaard back in 2013: ""What do you think? Do you think this story will help me get out of here, only for a little while, before I go?""

Burton wouldn't necessarily need Manson's corpse to make money, either: His son said last year that Manson's made a six-figure fortune selling art and memorabilia, which Star would stand to inherit. He also claimed she and Grey Wolf planned to sell the wedding photos for as much as $150,000.

So, is the ""glass case"" story bullshit? Hard to say, because it's not supported by direct quotes from Burton, who wouldn't comment to Page Six, or Manson, who lost his phone privileges years ago, and whose current whereabouts and medical condition the prison system won't reveal.

And even if they were talking, one is an unreliable, allegedly manipulative crazy person, and the other is Charles Manson.",murderous cult figurehead charles manson prison life received marriage license back november could tie knot afton star elaine burton come interview like another crazed admirer might though license lapsed without wedding one journalist claim manson got wise star alleged plan acquire corpse put public display money holy shit really know daniel simone working book manson told page six star burton associate craig gray wolf hammond scheming two year open lenin tomb style attraction california madman body view glass case two asked manson sign body simone say give definitive answer led keep bringing toiletry item prison marriage plot next step according simone attempt ensure star would get manson remains death certain thing next kin told ap last november saying wanted work manson case marriage would give access confidential information mention body manson let day marriage certificate lapse finally realized played fool simone claim adding manson think burton plan body stupid feel never die manson allegedly want get married burton hammond website claim though say manson plan renew license wedding postponed due unexpected interruption logistics playing back burton first announced engagement manson rolling stone manson dismissed snort oh say bunch garbage know man trash playing public consumption manson also called star baby floor implying manipulating like woman murderous family like shaved head carved x forehead request started one one know need say anything come like one played fool scenario burton claim manson think never die square manson told rolling stone contributor eric hedegaard back think think story help get little go burton necessarily need manson corpse make money either son said last year manson made six figure fortune selling art memorabilia star would stand inherit also claimed grey wolf planned sell wedding photo much glass case story bullshit hard say supported direct quote burton comment page six manson lost phone privilege year ago whose current whereabouts medical condition prison system reveal even talking one unreliable allegedly manipulative crazy person charles manson,california madman body view glass case two asked manson sign body simone say give definitive answer led keep bringing toiletry item prison marriage plot next step according simone attempt ensure star would get manson remains death certain thing next kin told last november saying wanted work manson case marriage would give access confidential information mention body manson let day marriage certificate lapse finally realized played fool simone claim adding manson think burton plan body stupid feel never die manson allegedly want get married burt
940,"Domino's was still killing it with the Noid in the '90s when McDonald's rolled out McPizzas to get in on ""the dinnertime business."" The fast-food chain made clever signs by tipping Golden Arches sideways into serviceable Zs, and Pizza Hut's copywriters predicted, ""Every place you see a McDonald's pizza, you're going to see a war."" Formidable as all that seemed, that war never came and McPizza became a nostalgic slice for countless millennials, which is why it's insane that two locations owned by a guy along the Ohio–West Virginia border are still cranking out the ""pizza you won't believa.""



Two decades ago, the chain's ""patented"" ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas — time-consuming McPizzas were the the McWraps of their day — so most were gone by 2000. It's not clear where Greg Mills's locations in the very small towns of Pomeroy, Ohio, and Spencer, West Virginia, are getting their raw materials for the discontinued menu items, but mysteriously, they're still selling.

943,"IBM is expected to go through a massive reorg next month that will reportedly see 26% of its 430,000-strong work force let go, or 111,800 people. If that figure holds true, that would make it far and away the largest corporate layoff event in history, breaking the record previously held by IBM, when it cut 60,000 in 1993.

The report comes from long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, who recently published an eBook on IBM's issues entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM. He blamed past CEOs Louis Gerstner and Sam Palmisano for making the mess and current CEO Virginia Rometty has done nothing to address them.

The problem is a complex mess of bad management – like laying off important people in the middle of a project – to getting sidetracked with pie-in-the-sky ideas like commercializing Watson and failing to adjust to the new era. The ""M"" in IBM may mean machines, but hardware is less than 10% of its business. Two-thirds is in services, and the services pipeline has dried up.

Why? Well, according to an ex-IBMer I spoke to some time ago, who confirmed what Cringely wrote in his book, IBM is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud. If you don't have a data center, you don't need an IBM service contract to manage it.


That's why IBM grabbed Softlayer, the cloud services provider. It needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Since the purchase 18 months ago, IBM has put a huge amount of money into SoftLayer and there has been a number of announcements around SoftLayer services.

Cringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts, which is pretty stupid considering IBM announced the new Z13 mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales. That won't be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it. Cutting storage is also foolish, as we are in the era of Big Data and Data Lakes and storage is vital to these concepts.

And you have to wonder what a layoff of 110,000 people will do to the firm. That has to be jarring. I remember an old advertisement from the print days that said ""What's worse, getting laid off on a Friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following Monday?"" This will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors, who will likely spend time updating their LinkedIn profiles.

The question I have to ask is why isn't Rometty one of the 110k. IBM has seen 11 straight quarters of declining revenue and it's hemorrhaging customers, according to both my source and Cringely. It's becoming apparent she is not up for the job and can't pull the company out of its nose dive.

Cringely said the layoffs will begin next week and by the end of February, all of the employees will be gone. If nothing else, IBM's first quarter numbers will take a monstrous hit from the severance packages for 111,000 employees. To say nothing of what this will do to its customer confidence.",ibm expected go massive reorg next month reportedly see strong work force let go people figure hold true would make far away largest corporate layoff event history breaking record previously held ibm cut featured resource presented jive software commandment collaboration exceptional customer service read whitepaper discover best practice drive brand affinity repeat business learn report come long time silicon valley journalist robert x cringely recently published ebook ibm issue entitled decline fall ibm blamed past ceo louis gerstner sam palmisano making mess current ceo virginia rometty done nothing address problem complex mess bad management like laying important people middle project getting sidetracked pie sky idea like commercializing watson failing adjust new era ibm may mean machine hardware le business two third service service pipeline dried well according ex ibmer spoke time ago confirmed cringely wrote book ibm still wedded service contract age company shutting internal data center entirely moving everything cloud data center need ibm service contract manage ibm grabbed softlayer cloud service provider needed get cloud fast behind microsoft google amazon since purchase month ago ibm put huge amount money softlayer number announcement around softlayer service cringely said mainframe storage area see deep cut pretty stupid considering ibm announced new z mainframe hope stimulate sale easy cut people supposed sell cutting storage also foolish era big data data lake storage vital concept wonder layoff people firm jarring remember old advertisement print day said worse getting laid friday told pick slack following monday undeniably upsetting survivor likely spend time updating linkedin profile question ask rometty one k ibm seen straight quarter declining revenue hemorrhaging customer according source cringely becoming apparent job pull company nose dive cringely said layoff begin next week end february employee gone nothing else ibm first quarter number take monstrous hit severance package employee say nothing customer confidence,sam palmisano making mess current ceo virginia rometty done nothing address problem complex mess bad management like laying important people middle project getting sidetracked pie sky idea like commercializing watson failing adjust new era ibm may mean machine hardware le business two third service service pipeline dried well according ex ibmer spoke time ago confirmed cringely wrote book ibm still wedded service contract age company shutting internal data center entirely moving everything cloud data center need ibm
946,"Last night, Pando’s Michael Carney cited a well-placed source who claims that Apple is on the verge of buying flailing social network, Path. Today, on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Path founder Dave Morin was asked about the report.

Morin’s response was straight from the Dummies Guide To Media Training: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation.” When TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino pointed out “that’s not a no,” Morin repeated his response.

There are a couple of things to note here. For one thing, from a PR point of view, Morin’s response was exactly right. If the deal is about to happen, then he’s hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time. If the deal isn’t about to happen, Morin can still benefit from the idea that Path is still valuable to someone.

And yet, it’s interesting how Morin’s “no comment” flies in the face of a promise he made to Pando’s Sarah Lacy last year about how he and Path would deal with the press in future. As Sarah explained at the time:

I explained the problem from the journalists’ side, and asked Morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog. Not a favorable one, but a fair one. Something that helps readers more than the denial, the reporter speculation, and the rewritten press release. He said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything. If a reporter gets a scoop, and it’s accurate and he or she calls him up, he’ll say congratulations and tell them to run with it. No more playing games.

Given Morin’s response on stage today, and the fact Carney contacted him last night for comment but received no response, perhaps a more accurate promise would have been “No more playing games, unless I’m scared shitless of upsetting Apple.”",last night pando michael carney cited well placed source claim apple verge buying flailing social network path today stage techcrunch disrupt path founder dave morin asked report morin response straight dummy guide medium training comment rumor speculation techcrunch matthew panzarino pointed morin repeated response couple thing note one thing pr point view morin response exactly right deal happen hardly going confirm stage reporter ahead time deal happen morin still benefit idea path still valuable someone yet interesting morin comment fly face promise made pando sarah lacy last year path would deal press future sarah explained time explained problem journalist side asked morin proposed publication entrepreneur want start fairer dialog favorable one fair one something help reader denial reporter speculation rewritten press release said part longer going obfuscate anything reporter get scoop accurate call say congratulation tell run playing game given morin response stage today fact carney contacted last night comment received response perhaps accurate promise would playing game unless scared shitless upsetting apple,last night pando michael carney cited well placed source claim apple verge buying flailing social network path today stage techcrunch disrupt path founder dave morin asked report morin response straight dummy guide medium training comment rumor speculation techcrunch matthew panzarino pointed morin repeated response couple thing note one thing pr point view morin response exactly right deal happen morin still benefit idea path still valuable someone yet interesting morin comment fly face promise made pando sarah lac
953,"(Sept. 22, 2014, update 1:09 p.m.) A high-ranking source tells the Cape Cod Times that the three Afghan soldiers who were reported missing after leaving a training exercise at Camp Edwards on Cape Cod have been located at the Canadian border, apparently seeking asylum.

The source has been briefed on the issue, but could not be quoted on the record because he was not authorized to speak.

U.S. Central Command could not immediately confirm the information.

The Afghan soldiers went missing Saturday at Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady said the three men were reported missing on Saturday night after travelling into Hyannis that day.

“They didn't report back (to the base),” Sahady said. “There is no indication they pose a threat to the public.”

Police and base officials were cooperating in the search for the three men, identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar. Sahady didn't have any descriptions or ages for the three officers.

A state police spokesman said they are not involved in the investigation.

There are 200 soldiers and civilians participating in the seven day event at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. Along with 12 other members of the Afghanistan National Army, the three men were all engaged in the joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies that involved civilians and officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said. There were six nations, including the U.S. participating in the exercise which is ongoing and is scheduled to wrap up by Wednesday. They were housed on the base and all participants at the exercise were all vetted by U.S. Central Command, Sahady said.

U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Jon Custis of the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., who organized the training exercise, did not return a call Sunday seeking comment.

“They had the freedom to come and go,” Sahady said. “If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall.”

The three arrived in the country on Sept. 11, Sahady said. Saturday was a free day. They were last spotted Saturday night at the Cape Cod Mall, Sahady said.

960,"Shocked surgeons say Iga Jasica, 19, was never in danger despite her regaining consciousness while her brain was exposed

A teenager woke up in the middle of a brain operation and asked doctors how it was going before chatting about cats.

Iga Jasica, 19, had been taken to the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland for the operation to remove a cancerous growth.

But halfway through the critical surgery she woke up after the anaesthetic wore off and started talking to the surgeons about how it was going.

Doctors say her brain was exposed at the time.

Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said: ""Despite coming round she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger.""

He said the young woman would not have been able to see or feel anything.

Experts said the operation may have triggered something that caused her to come round despite the anaesthetic, but doctors are also investigating whether the anaesthetic was properly applied.

963,"BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 29 (UPI) -- Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner adopted Jewish boy Yair Tawil as her godson to protect him from the stigma of a folk tale prophesying he will turn into a werewolf.
In Argentina, there is a legend the seventh son born to a family with no daughters will turn into ""el lobison"" or a werewolf upon his 13th birthday. The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons. To counteract this stigma, the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson.

Tawil is the first Jewish godson as the honor only applied to Catholic boys until 2009. His parents asked for the honor in 1993 but were denied. He appealed to Kirchner, citing the 2009 decree and was accepted as the candidate.

The family met with Kirchner and presented her with a menorah they lit for Hanukkah.",buenos aire dec upi argentinian president cristina kirchner adopted jewish boy yair tawil godson protect stigma folk tale prophesying turn werewolf argentina legend seventh son born family daughter turn el lobison werewolf upon th birthday legend became feared family would abandon kill son counteract stigma president argentina began adopt one boy godson tawil first jewish godson honor applied catholic boy parent asked honor denied appealed kirchner citing decree accepted candidate family met kirchner presented menorah lit hanukkah,argentina began adopt one boy godson tawil godson honor applied catholic boy parent asked honor denied appeal kirchner citing decree accepted candidate family met kirchner presented menorah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit hanukkah lit
967,"With Apple looking to take some serious security measures in order to protect the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch Edition, there is little doubt that the wearable from the company could well be the most expensive mobile gadget it has ever sold. More details to follow, right after the jump.

Apple Watch is the Cupertino-based company’s first ever endeavor into the wearable market, and as is the case with all Apple devices, this little hand-worn gadget will not settle for being just another trendy smartwatch, with the company looking to create a new luxury niche for its loyal, or potentially new line of wealthy consumers. To be launched in three variants; Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition, it is the third variant that happens to be expensive enough for the company to consider employing jewelry store-styled security protocols to protect it.

Apple-Watch-Edition-main

With 18-karat of gold on the Apple Watch Edition, 9to5Mac is reporting that the Cupertino company is bolstering up its security across all its stores and has begun placing safes coupled with MagSafe chargers in outlets that would sell the wearable in the future. More so, the stores will also be using scales to weigh the watches upon return to ascertain that no gold has been removed from the device. Apple Stores have had their share of experiences with robberies before, and the company is not willing to take a chance this time around, with all the demo units and Watch Edition stock to be placed in these safes.

All this talk about scales being used for processing any returned Apple Watch Edition may not tell us just how much gold would Apple’s luxury wearable be actually carrying for now, but we can guess there’s plenty to be removed to cause a significant decrease in weight to show up on a precision weighing scale. This is where you can draw a conclusion that the particular version of Apple’s smartwatch could in fact be worth thousands of dollars.

Apple-Watch

Meanwhile, Tim Cook has already announced that the company’s ""most personal device ever"", will begin shipping out this April. We already know that the Apple Watch – the entrant version – will cost $349, but the company has remained silent on the Watch Edition.

970,"MOSCOW, October 16 (RIA Novosti), Ekaterina Blinova - The Islamic State (IS or), also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) beheads and crucifies its own fighters if they break the laws and ruling of the terrorist organization.
""ISIS is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime, which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement,"" Charlie Winter, the Quilliam Foundation think tank Program Officer, told the Independent.
The media outlet reports that at least two ISIL jihadists have been publicly executed for spying and embezzlement in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal. It is still unclear whether the men were beheaded or crucified, since both forms of punishment are widely used by the Islamic State militants.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, one of the executed fighters was charged with ""banditry and robbing Muslims' money"" and the second one was accused of ""dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,"" as cited by the Independent.
Experts say they are not surprised by the harsh methods used by the IS, as decapitation and crucifying are common forms of punishment practiced by Sunni Wahhabi sectarians.
""Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone’s monthly income, they don’t extort people like some secular groups have done in the past,"" notes Charlie Winter.
Experts emphasize that decapitation has long been a routine practice in Saudi Arabia, a country where Islam's Sharia Law is used.
""According to Amnesty International at least 79 people were executed [beheaded] in Saudi Arabia in 2013 and between 1 January and 18 August this year 34 more people were executed, making a total of 113. This does not include any estimates for executions at the end of 2012,"" the Independent reported in September 2014.

IBM is reportedly planning its largest corporate layoff ever - cutting 111,800 of its staff.

A report by a respected Silicon Valley journalist for Forbes said around 26% of the company's 430,000-strong workforce would be cut this week.

The previous largest corporate redundancy was also carried out by IBM, when it cut 60,000 staff in 1993.

The company's reorganisation is codenamed Project Chrome, and most of the staff being laid off are in the US.

It will pave the way for IBM to focus on cloud computing, it is claimed, rather than its traditional hardware business.

Reporter Robert X Cringely wrote: ""To fix its business problems and speed up its 'transformation', next week about 26% of IBM's employees will be getting phone calls from their managers.

""A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork.""

However, some technology commentators have said they are sceptical about the size of the reported cuts.

In a statement to Sky News, an IBM spokeswoman said the rumour was ""ridiculous"" and ""baseless"".

She said: ""If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing.

""This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported.

""Last year, IBM hired 45,000 people, and the company currently has about 15,000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies.

""This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace.

IBM was founded in 1911 and adopted the name International Business Machines in 1924.

It currently creates hardware and software, and provides infrastructure, hosting and consulting services.

985,"The Islamic militant group ISIS beheaded Steven Joel Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who was abducted a year ago in Syria, in a video made public Tuesday by a jihadist monitoring organization.

The monitoring organization, SITE Intel Group, announced on Twitter that Sotloff had been beheaded. It said that ISIS had also threatened to execute a British captive, David Cawthorne Haines.

Last week, Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, pleaded directly with the leader of ISIS to spare her son.

“We have not seen Steven for over a year, and we miss him very much,” she said in a video message to the ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “We want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him.”

Sotloff, 31, wrote about conflict in the Middle East for Time magazine and other publications. He grew up in Miami and attended the University of Central Florida in the early 2000s. He has a Twitter account, and last posted Aug. 3, 2013, just before he disappeared.

ISIS threatened Sotloff’s life in another video last month. In that video, ISIS beheaded another American journalist, James Foley, and said that it would kill Sotloff, too, unless the United States ended airstrikes against the militant group.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that he could not confirm the authenticity of the Sotloff video. He said that the United States had devoted significant time and resources to rescuing Sotloff. The CIA also said that it could not confirm authenticity.",islamic militant group isi beheaded steven joel sotloff american freelance journalist abducted year ago syria video made public tuesday jihadist monitoring organization monitoring organization site intel group announced twitter sotloff beheaded said isi also threatened execute british captive david cawthorne haines last week sotloff mother shirley pleaded directly leader isi spare son seen steven year miss much said video message isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi want see home safe sound hug sotloff wrote conflict middle east time magazine publication grew miami attended university central florida early twitter account last posted aug disappeared isi threatened sotloff life another video last month video isi beheaded another american journalist james foley said would kill sotloff unless united state ended airstrikes militant group white house press secretary josh earnest said could confirm authenticity sotloff video said united state devoted significant time resource rescuing sotloff cia also said could confirm authenticity,isi beheaded steven joel sotloff american freelance journalist abducted year ago syria video made public tuesday jihadist monitoring organization monitoring organization site intel group announced twitter sotloff beheaded said isi also threatened execute british captive david cawthorne haines last week sotloff mother shirley pleaded directly leader isi spare son seen steven year miss much said video message isi leader abu
987,"No craving can be more important than your health as the North Korean leader finds it out the hard way. Kim Jong-un broke his ankle after he had put on extra weight from regularly consuming imported cheese, said a report on Tuesday.

And the reason for his mysterious disappearance has been finally put to rest when his condition was revealed. He was put to bed after a surgery to fix his fractured ankles.

Uncontrolled daily eating of Emmental, imported from Switzerland, is believed to be responsible for his rapid weight gain, the metro.co.uk reported.

The report citing a South Korean daily said that the tyrant is recovering from the fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury - and caused the bones to crack.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" the South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo quoted a source as saying.

The emails suggested information stolen during the hack could be released if Sony fails to ensure that the film is never seen:

The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, “Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.”

The message also says, “And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.”

994,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima.",new tv show peru captured moment unwitting men caught wolf whistling mother experiment took two mother whose son identified repeat cat caller disguised using make wig clothes woman woman walked past son gauge reaction mother wearing disguise wig sunglass walk past unsuspecting son friend make comment towards mother go confront child still unaware woman actually parent man act horror realises mother launch tirade accusing dirty mother get angry son take bag proceeds hit due behaviour first case mother dressed short black dress walk past son friend street son unwittingly make comment mother saying tasty panty prompt go confront remove sunglass man realises cat called mother mother launch tirade accusing dirty saying never taught talk woman manner another mother wearing black wig walk past son standing working street lima making remark towards mother turn around go confront take wig reveal throw floor anger disgusted son behaviour mother tell son ashamed speaking like pleads calm get angry child remove bag hit meanwhile second case mother wearing green dress walk past son call piggy call name taking wig confronting son hitting hairpiece man try claim make remark forced apologise mother walk launch tirade telling son ashamed pleads mother quieten working try claim make remark man nearby car eventually apologises mother walk video end warning saying men start respecting woman unwittingly harass mother come video claim seven woman say experienced sexual harassment street peruvian capital lima,peru captured moment unwitting men caught wolf whistling mother experiment took two mother whose son identified repeat cat caller disguised using make wig clothes woman woman woman walked past son gauge reaction mother wearing disguise wig sunglass walk past unsuspecting son friend make comment towards mother go confront child still unaware woman actually parent man act horror realises mother launch tirade accusing dirty mother get angry son take bag proceeds hit due behaviour first case mother dressed short black dress walk past son friend street son unwittingly make comment

998,"An astonishing image appears to show a giant crab, nearly 50 feet across, lurking in the harbor at Whitstable, Kent, and while some assert that it is a playful hoax, others believe they have found evidence of a genuine aquatic monster.

The aerial image reveals the outline of a crab at the mouth of Kent harbor, yet the size of the animal dwarfs fishing boats on a nearby pier, as the Daily Mail notes. The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.

People have flocked to the website Weird Whitstable since the image was first posted there, to judge its authenticity for themselves. Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.

While crabbing with his son in Whitstable harbor last year, Winter claims to have spotted the giant crab near shore, as he related to The Daily Express.

Save yourselves, Crabzilla has arrived in Whitstable http://t.co/W2NgcmJP24 pic.twitter.com/7RuUxSBUhB

— Sara Nelson (@SaraCNelson) October 13, 2014

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood,’ Winter said. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws… Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

In July of last year, another image emerged, depicting a giant crab lurking underneath a pier.

Another image, said to be taken in July of last year and posted on Winter’s Weird Whitstablog, purports to show a giant, albeit smaller, crab hiding under a pier.

“This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend,” claims Winter’s website, adding “The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

Graphic artist Ashley Austen noted his skepticism of the aerial image while speaking to Kent Online, describing the way in which such a photograph could be easily manufactured.

“The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop,” he said. “All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbor and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.”

Earlier this year, another photograph of an unknown creature emerged from England, appearing to show “Bownessie,” an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster. As The Inquisitr noted at the time, the surprisingly clear image was met with claims that it had been similarly created in Photoshop.

The largest known species of crustacean is the Japanese Spider Crab. Giant in comparison to other known species of crab, adults can grow to be 12 feet across.

1005,"The stand-off between an office worker, known only as 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' and their colleague, 'Sandwich Thief' has become an internet hit

This office note battle between a cheeky sandwich thief and their jobsworth nemesis might just be the funniest thing you read all day.

If you've ever worked in an office, you'll be familiar with those who are possessive about their lunch and partial to a passive-aggressive note.

And if those people annoy you, this funny note war should give you a giggle.

The battle breaks out when someone has a sandwich stolen from the office fridge.

Clearly irked, they leave their light-fingered a note, telling them to stop stealing.

And the subsequent string of letters between the two doesn't disappoint.

Check out the hilarious exchanges between the two below.

1023,"Yemen’s Houthi rebels seized weapons from U.S. Marines as well as several vehicles used by Americans stationed at the now-closed U.S. Embassy in Sana’a.

It wasn’t immediately clear what types of weapons and vehicles were seized.

An unidentified Sana'a airport official confirmed that the rebel forces took control of the U.S. Embassy vehicles, which were parked at the airport, United Press International reported. The same official also said that the Houthi rebels seized several weapons used by U.S. Marines who were trying to abide by a White House order and leave the country.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a widely reported statement: “The Department of State has decided to suspend our embassy operations and our embassy staff have been temporarily relocated out of Sana'a. Recent unilateral actions disrupted the political transition process in Yemen, creating the risk that renewed violence would threaten Yemenis and the diplomatic community in Sana'a.”

British and French embassies have been temporarily closed, with Germany, perhaps, not far behind.

1030,"BUTTE — Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington is a wanted man in these parts. Too bad neither the position nor the man exist.

A satirical story about Rob O’Neill posted on the Internet has prompted everyone from Associated Press reporters to Louisiana law enforcement officers to call local authorities for information.

Empire News posted a bogus article Monday titled “Bin Laden Shooter Rob O’Neill Mistakenly Attacked by Street Thugs Seeking To Collect Debt From Neighbor.”

“Nothing in the story has a resemblance of truth,” Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich said Wednesday.

Skuletich does exist, for the record.

What is fabricated in the article includes: the police commissioner, five gang members seeking a drug debt and the Butte Daily Times. Also, O’Neill did not take down the intruders and brew a pot of coffee while awaiting backup.

“We’ve been getting all kinds of calls from across the country,” Sheriff Ed Lester said.

The article has been making its rounds on social media sites. This prompted Snopes.com to label it false.

“Empire News is one of many fake news sites responsible for the frequent hoodwinking of Facebook users. Among previous hoaxes were a yarn about welfare recipients getting free cars, a claim that Colorado legalized meth and a widely shared story about pending ‘snowmageddon,’” Snopes notes.

The piece claims that members of the Crips gang broke into the home of the former Navy SEAL and Butte native.

“We don’t have established Bloods or Crips here,” Lester added.

The story goes: “As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!”

While some might find the fake news piece amusing, local police are reminded of another hoax of a girl who reportedly shot intruders: An 11-year-old Butte girl was reported to have taken out two crooks. She was reportedly a clay-shooting champion in Butte who killed one man with a shot to the genitals and the other bled out.

That bogus story reappears about every year or so, Lester said.",butte butte police commissioner bartholomew harrington wanted man part bad neither position man exist satirical story rob neill posted internet prompted everyone associated press reporter louisiana law enforcement officer call local authority information empire news posted bogus article monday titled bin laden shooter rob neill mistakenly attacked street thug seeking collect debt neighbor nothing story resemblance truth butte silver bow undersheriff george skuletich said wednesday skuletich exist record fabricated article includes police commissioner five gang member seeking drug debt butte daily time also neill take intruder brew pot coffee awaiting backup getting kind call across country sheriff ed lester said article making round social medium site prompted snopes com label false empire news one many fake news site responsible frequent hoodwinking facebook user among previous hoax yarn welfare recipient getting free car claim colorado legalized meth widely shared story pending snowmageddon snopes note piece claim member crips gang broke home former navy seal butte native established blood crips lester added story go five thug ran aimlessly home mr neill used silent hand hand combat tactic individually disarm weapon mr neill taken five men secured home brewed pot coffee called police station boy sure find wrong house might find fake news piece amusing local police reminded another hoax girl reportedly shot intruder year old butte girl reported taken two crook reportedly clay shooting champion butte killed one man shot genitals bled bogus story reappears every year lester said,butte butte police commissioner bartholomew harrington wanted man part bad neither position man exist satirical story rob neill posted internet prompted everyone associated press reporter louisiana law enforcement officer call local authority information empire news posted bogus article monday titled bin laden shooter rob neill mistakenly attacked street thug seeking collect debt neighbor nothing story resemblance truth butte daily time also neill take intruder brew
1031,"e Islamic State militant group released a video today purporting to show the beheading of U.S. hostage Steven J. Sotloff.

A masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage, a man the group named as David Haines, and warned governments to back off ""this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State"", the SITE Intelligence Group monitoring service said.

Sotloff, a freelance journalist, was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. Sotloff's mother Shirley appealed on Aug. 27 in a videotaped message to Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for her son's release.

The White House said it could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing that if there is such a video, it would be analyzed very carefully, adding that the administration's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.

Shortly before the briefing, the SITE monitoring service said the militant group had released the video.

On Aug. 19 the group published a video showing the beheading of U.S. hostage James Foley, a Marquette and Northwestern alum. The group said his death was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes on fighters in Iraq.

That video was issued after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq in August for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011.

After Islamic State's beheading of journalist James Foley, President Barack Obama's administration is making little headway in efforts to secure the release of other Americans held by the insurgent group in Syria, officials said.

The U.S. government has said it does not pay ransoms or negotiate with the Islamic State.

Washington has contacted about two dozen countries for help in freeing the three, but no foreign government appears to have influence over or even significant contact with IS, which has declared an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.

""What we've found is that ISIS isn't responsive"" to outreach, said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity and using an alternate acronym for the group.

Another administration official said Washington was working with other Western countries whose citizens are being held hostage, and with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and others in the region thought by the United States to possibly have influence with the groups Al-Nusrah and IS.

The hostages' fate received little public attention until Islamic State posted an online video on Aug. 19 showing Foley's beheading. It now presents a frustrating challenge for Obama.

Islamic State ""is far more difficult to deal with"" than Iran or the militant group Hezbollah, which also took Americans captive, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think-tank. The group ""wants to terrorize Americans, it's not really interested in deals.""

WHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT
U.S. officials and supporters of the remaining hostages requested that most details about them and efforts to free them be withheld.

One of the other U.S. hostages is a female aid worker, age 26, for whom Islamic State has demanded $6.6 million in ransom, according to ABC News.

Lisa Monaco, Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, has been ""very deeply involved in this,"" the senior U.S. official said. Monaco, along with the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been in contact with hostages' families, the official said.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said, "" The Administration has had regular interactions with the families of those Americans who have been held hostage in Syria since the kidnapping of their loved ones. These interactions included representatives from all the relevant agencies, including the Department of State, the FBI, the Intelligence Community, and the White House.""

Obama authorized a covert raid in Syria in July to rescue Foley and other American hostages, but they were not at the site where they were thought to be held. Another rescue attempt would be risky for U.S. special forces and the hostages.

The American diplomatic effort also is aimed at persuading European countries not to pay ransoms, officials said.


U.S. and European officials have said that France, Spain and Italy have tolerated or facilitated ransom payments for citizens held in Syria. Islamic State released numerous European journalists this year, including two Spaniards in March and four Frenchmen in April.

The French government has denied a news report that it paid a ransom to free the four. Spain's foreign ministry has not commented on the matter.

The U.S. policy of refusing to pay ransoms to discourage further hostage-taking ""is as close as we are likely to come to governments influencing ISIS on the matter of seizing hostages"", said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA analyst now at Georgetown University.

U.S. officials have said that Qatar played a critical role in persuading a rival group in Syria, the official al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, to free American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, whom it had been holding since 2012.

Qatar is working to help free other Americans held captive in Syria, a Gulf source told Reuters, but U.S. officials said the Qatari government has little if any leverage with Islamic State.

1032,"Microsoft is in serious discussions to buy Mojang, the independent Swedish studio responsible for Minecraft, in a deal estimated at more than $2 billion, The Wall Street Journal reports. An agreement could be signed this week, the site says.

Mojang has historically been proud of its independence, shying away from acquisition offers and from entering the public market. Mojang co-founder and Minecraft mastermind Markus ""Notch"" Persson turned down a job in 2010 at the most desirable gaming company in America, Valve, in order to continue work on Minecraft.

Last year, Mojang co-founder Carl Manneh said to Reuters, ""We've always felt that the independence we have is one of our core strengths. We can take decisions by going into a room and in 15 minutes we're done. We try to be extremely agile, to release games quickly.""

In 2013, Mojang brought in a reported $326 million in revenue. Asked about the deal, a Microsoft spokesperson told Joystiq, ""We don't comment on rumors or speculation.""

1033,"Raven-Symone did NOT file molestation charges against Bill Cosby. A hoax report that has gone viral amid renewed rape allegations against Cosby claims the former child star “revealed to the TMZ offices that she too had been raped and drugged” by Cosby following the final episode of “The Cosby Show.” The story is 100 percent false and fake.

The actress herself took to Instagram on Wednesday to shoot down the story: “I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!”

TMZ has nothing to do with the original phony story. It was started by something called Hip Hop Hangover, an unfunny parody site, and then shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook. Large outlets like the Indian version of International Business Times picked it up and treated the fake allegations like they were real.

The post contains phony quotes from a purported lawyer for Raven-Symone, including a fake press announcement that declares, “We among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed.” No actual lawyer for the real Raven-Symone ever made such a statement.

Again, Raven-Symone has NOT actually claimed Cosby molested or raped her. The article is a hoax timed to exploit the very serious allegations against Cosby by women including Janice Dickinson and Joan Tarshis. It’s appalling that outlets would spread this “satirical” story about Raven-Symone without checking first.",raven symone file molestation charge bill cosby hoax report gone viral amid renewed rape allegation cosby claim former child star revealed tmz office raped drugged cosby following final episode cosby show story percent false fake actress took instagram wednesday shoot story taking advantage mr cosby cosby show practically baby show truly disgusting rumor want part everyone show treated nothing kindness keep tmz nothing original phony story started something called hip hop hangover unfunny parody site shared time facebook large outlet like indian version international business time picked treated fake allegation like real post contains phony quote purported lawyer raven symone including fake press announcement declares among many others tired medium worshipping praising man past terrible unbelievable client raven symone also ready tell side story side kept quiet threat blackballed actual lawyer real raven symone ever made statement raven symone actually claimed cosby molested raped article hoax timed exploit serious allegation cosby woman including janice dickinson joan tarshis appalling outlet would spread satirical story raven symone without checking first,phony quote purported lawyer raven symone including fake press announcement declare among many others tired medium worshipping praising man past terrible unbelievable client raven symone also ready tell side story side kept quiet threat blackballed actual lawyer real raven symone ever made statement raven symone actually claimed cosby molested raped article hoax timed exploit serious allegation cosby woman including janice dickinson joan tar

1038,"The terrorist group is reportedly demanding one million dollars to deliver the journalist's body across the Syrian border to Turkey

The Islamic State is trying to sell the the remains of beheaded hostage James Foley to his parents for $1million, it has been claimed.

With the terrorist group failing to strike ransom deals, it is now trying to negotiate the sales of at least one of the men it has killed.

Sources with ties to ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of the US journalist whose death was the first in a series of high-profile executions.

They said that for $1 million, around £638,000, the group would deliver Mr Foley’s body across the border to Turkey, and would provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.

All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety.

One of the three sources seeking to act as middlemen - a former Syrian rebel fighter - said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley’s family.

He said: “They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” he said.

“They will not give the DNA without the money.”

He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work “a humanity case.”

Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals, saying: “This is business.”

The Foley family had no comment for the the website's article.

An official with the U.S. State Department said “we are seeking more information” on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of US hostages.

1039,"The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has beheaded Steven Joel Sotloff, the second American executed by the Islamic militant group, and posted a video of it on the Internet, the SITE Intelligence Group, a research organization that tracks jihadist web postings, said Tuesday.

The execution of Mr. Sotloff, 31, came despite pleas from his mother aimed directly at ISIS’s top leader seeking mercy for her son, a freelance journalist who was captured in northern Syria a year ago.

Word of Mr. Sotloff’s beheading came two weeks after James Foley, 45, another American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS, which warned that Mr. Sotloff would be the next to die.

In the latest video, Mr. Sotloff describes himself as “paying the price” for the Obama administration’s decision to strike ISIS targets in Iraq. The same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Mr. Foley’s beheading also appears beside Mr. Sotloff, asserting, “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.”

The SITE group also said ISIS was threatening a third captive, a Briton it identified David Cawthorne Haines, as the next beheading victim.

1044,"After deploying tear gas to break up pro-democracy demonstrators, police in Hong Kong warned late Sunday local time that they will use “a higher level of force” against the crowds of thousands if “public order” is not restored.

Demonstrators have gathered outside government headquarters near the city’s financial district calling for the Chinese government to grant democratic reforms in Hong Kong. An overwhelming amount of protesters were seen mimicking the symbolic “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture used throughout protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown.

Students – many of whom have already boycotted a week of classes – and activists began camping out on Friday, and were later joined by members of a civil disobedience movement known as Occupy Central.



Protesters told the Associated Press that the demonstrations were peaceful when riot police started to use pepper spray and launch tear gas canisters. That sent coughing protesters running in all directions, but many later reconvened vowing to keep the rally going. Police officers were wearing both helmets and respirators to protect them from the gas.

Government leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing called the demonstrations “unlawful” and “illegal” respectively, but many protesters say they will not waver.

“If today I don’t stand out, I will hate myself in future,” taxi driver Edward Yeung told Reuters. “Even if I get a criminal record,” he said, “it will be a glorious one.”

Hong Kong does have some some autonomy from Beijing which took over sovereignty of the former British colony in 1997.

But Beijing has asserted more control in the city in recent months. This includes requiring Beijing’s approval of election candidates and allegations of intimidation from mainland officials on free business practices in Hong Kong, according to The Washington Post. Occupy Central vowed to protest the Chinese government’s actions back in June when the city’s Beijing-backed leader said a trio of reforms the group was suggesting failed to comply with existing laws, The New York Times reported.

Beijing has promised Hong Kong a free election to choose its leader by 2017, but pro-democracy supporters there and Chinese officials on the mainland have so far failed to agree on guidelines for such a vote.

Government officials in Hong Kong warned that the continued demonstrations may disrupt public transport in the financial hub on Monday, Reuters reported. Police have not used tear gas in Hong Kong in nearly a decade, according to NBC News. The tactic was last used in 2005 during World Trade Organization protests.

“We will fight until the end,” one protester told NBC News. “We will never give up.” Another protester – a student named Alexandra Wong – said, “We will not just say yes to whatever they do. We will fight for our rights, and fight for our democracy.”",deploying tear gas break pro democracy demonstrator police hong kong warned late sunday local time use higher level force crowd thousand public order restored demonstrator gathered outside government headquarters near city financial district calling chinese government grant democratic reform hong kong overwhelming amount protester seen mimicking symbolic hand shoot gesture used throughout protest ferguson missouri killing unarmed teen michael brown student many already boycotted week class activist began camping friday later joined member civil disobedience movement known occupy central protester told associated press demonstration peaceful riot police started use pepper spray launch tear gas canister sent coughing protester running direction many later reconvened vowing keep rally going police officer wearing helmet respirator protect gas government leader hong kong beijing called demonstration unlawful illegal respectively many protester say waver today stand hate future taxi driver edward yeung told reuters even get criminal record said glorious one hong kong autonomy beijing took sovereignty former british colony beijing asserted control city recent month includes requiring beijing approval election candidate allegation intimidation mainland official free business practice hong kong according washington post occupy central vowed protest chinese government action back june city beijing backed leader said trio reform group suggesting failed comply existing law new york time reported beijing promised hong kong free election choose leader pro democracy supporter chinese official mainland far failed agree guideline vote government official hong kong warned continued demonstration may disrupt public transport financial hub monday reuters reported police used tear gas hong kong nearly decade according nbc news tactic last used world trade organization protest fight end one protester told nbc news never give another protester student named alexandra wong said say yes whatever fight right fight democracy,tear gas break pro democracy demonstrator police hong kong warned late sunday local time use higher level force crowd thousand public order restored demonstrator gathered outside government headquarters near city financial district . protester seen mimicking symbolic hand shoot gesture used throughout protest ferguson missouri killing unarmed teen michael brown student many already boycotted week class activist began camping friday later joined member civil disobedience movement known occupy central protester told associated press demonstration peaceful riot police started use pepper spray launch tear

1052,"Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says militants were killed in Al-Bukamal

Isis militants have reportedly publicly executed at least two of their own fighters in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal, on charges of spying and embezzlement.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first militant was executed for “banditry and robbing Muslims’ money”. The second militant was allegedly killed for “dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen”.

The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.

There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.

Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising.             He told The Independent: “Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement.

“Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone’s monthly income, they don’t extort people like some secular groups have done in the past.”

1054,"The Sony hackers are taking a victory lap.

CNN's Brian Stelter obtained an email sent by the hackers to top Sony executives.

In the email, the hackers say Sony made the right decision pulling ""The Interview."" They promise not to leak any more private Sony data unless Sony reverses its decision and distributes the movie anyway.

Here's the email, as read on air by Stelter:

It's very wise that you have made a decision to cancel the release of The Interview. It will be very useful for you ... We ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.

Here's another letter that the hacker group, which goes by Guardians of Peace (GOP), posted on PasteBin:

This is GOP.

You have suffered through enough threats.

We lift the ban.

But be carful.

Sony decided to pull ""The Interview"" premiere on Wednesday after five of the top movie theater chains said they wouldn't show the movie following threats by GOP.

Sony also said it has no plans to release the movie through video on demand or online.

Sony's decision has caused a lot of debate about what kind of precedent it sets when a major coportation bends to the will of hackers or terrorists. The FBI is expected to announce Friday afternoon that North Korea was involved in the Sony hacks.

1059,"Reports have claimed that Apple is ready to announce an acquisition of Path, the struggling social network. Pando, citing an anonymous source working in Apple's engineering team, claims that the social network may be integrated into Apple's Messages app.

So what will Apple be getting when it acquires Path? Here's a guide.

One of Path's most unique features is just how much power it gives users over who can see their posts. Users are limited to just 150 friends, with no option to share posts publicly.

As well as sharing posts to their friends, Path users can also create an ""Inner Circle"" of friends who can see their most private posts.

Path is often praised for its design, with Apple even featuring the social network in keynote slides. The app includes minimalist navigation icons and clock hands that spin as you scroll through the timeline.

Apple's short-lived iTunes Ping service allowed users to share the music they were listening to, as well as keep track of famous musicians. Shuttered two years after its launch, the app failed to gain a significant number of users.

But a major feature of Path is very similar to Apple's Ping service. The app offers the ability to share what music you're listening to with friends.

One of Path's more unique features is the ability to share what times you go to sleep and wake up. Tap the sleep button, and Path will ask you whether you're conscious or not.

Select ""Go to Sleep"" and the app shows a night sky and a moon to get you in the mood.

When you wake up, tap the ""Awake"" button next to the sun icon to inform all of your Path friends that you are awake.

Path's latest update was the launch of a new messaging app in June. Path Talk lets you messages your Path friends, as well as share a whole load of information about yourself through the app.

As well as sensing when you're traveling on trains and in cars, the app can also continually broadcast your battery level.

Currently, Path earns money by selling virtual stickers and photo filters.

The app also sells a ""Premium"" subscription that gives you unlimited virtual stickers and photo filters.

1061,"An angry woman in China tried to make sure her cheating husband would never cheat again.

According to The Mirror, 32-year-old Fan Lung used his wife's phone to send his lover, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, a sexual message. When he forgot to log out of his account, his wife, Feng, saw the message, grabbed a pair of scissors and cut off her husband's penis when he was sleeping.

Fan Lung was taken to a hospital where his penis was sewn back on. However, Feng was able to sneak into the hospital, cut off her husband's penis a second time and then throw it out a window.

After the second snip, Lung defended himself and attacked his wife.

A hospital spokesman said, ""The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.""

Feng is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm.

Meanwhile, Lung's 21-year-old lover plans to marry him as soon as possible.

1062,"I’ve been thinking about the blurred lines between Apple’s luxury tech products and high-end jewelry ever since it was first revealed that Apple Stores average more sales per square foot than iconic diamond retailer Tiffany & Co.

Apple is apparently thinking about it, too, since 9to5Mac reporter Mark Gurman claims the Cupertino company is taking a page out of luxury jewelers’ playbook by keeping its 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition devices in specially installed safes. These custom safes will be fitted with Apple Watch MagSafe chargers to ensure their safety.

Set to arrive this April, the Apple Watch will offer numerous pricing options, starting at $350 and likely running into the thousands. They will come in two bezel colors: silver and gold, along with a range of different leather and sport bands.

The smartwatch itself was unveiled along with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on September 9 last year. In addition to numerous sensors, the Apple Watch’s big selling point is its ""Digital Crown,"" which allows wearers to control apps on the watch’s sapphire display. Currently the devices are being tested by hundreds of Apple employees to ensure that as many bugs as possible are eliminated by launch date.

Apple is also getting ready to switch up the current Apple Store layout to include Apple Watch display tables, along with an area where people can try on different band materials and color options. Finally, the company is said to be investing in scales that they can use to weigh the amount of gold in Apple Watch Edition units should they be returned or replaced.

1067,"Islamic State has turned its hand to human organ trafficking to fund terror across the Middle East, it has been claimed.

The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest from a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.

But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria.

Lucrative: The terror organisation even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

Evil: The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest through a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.

The shocking news was revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.

He told the site that IS commanders have hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in the captured city of Mosul, northern Iraq, that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

It claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.

'[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.'

Shocking: But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria

Black market: The report claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'

Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.

While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.

One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Drugs in Europe: IS' drug business has become so successful in recent months that the Russian Federal Drug Control Service claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market

Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'

Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market.

'The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe,' the Russian Federal Drug Control Service issued in a statement.

1072,"Mittens, a stray cat with both male and female genitalia, is to undergo gender reassignment surgery after being taken in by a caring family.

The Murphy family discovered their new-found pet’s dual-gender after taking it to a local veterinarian for an examination.

Surgery is required for the cat because the dual genitalia are causing bowel and urinary issues.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy, the cat’s new owner, had hoped for Mittens to become female, but vets advised her to assign the cat’s gender as male.

Ms Clarke-Murphy from Newfoundland in Canada told CBC: ‘I’d like for it to be a female, but it really doesn’t matter.

‘She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter.’

The cat will be both spayed and neutered before reconstructive surgery is carried out.

The $1,500 (£802) bill for the complicated surgery will be met thanks to a friend of the family who is auctioning old items on Facebook.

1078,"It was like any other wedding ceremony in India, where 25-year-old Jugal Kishore was to wed 23-year-old Indira.

But once the varmala ceremony – where the groom garlands his wife to be – started, the groom suddenly had an epileptic fit, and fell to the ground.

Multiple news outlets reported that the bride, upon realising that the groom and his family had kept this serious medical condition from her, was furious. In her angered state, she allegedly declared that she would happily marry Harpal Singh, one of the guests at the wedding. The reports further state that Singh, incidentally, was her sister’s brother-in-law.

Singh, dressed in a leather jacket and jeans, was completely taken aback by the strange situation, and after a bit of hesitation, declared that he would willingly marry Indira.

The ceremony continued with the substitution of grooms, Singh and Indira together participating in the varmala ceremony, after which the pandit, officiating the ceremony, recited the mantras and asked the new couple to take the seven pheras, a ritual in Hindu weddings in which the couple make several rounds around a sacred fire.

Kishore, meanwhile, had been rushed to the hospital, and when he regained consciousness, returned to find his fiancée already wed.

The Times of India reported that Kishore requested that Indira reconsider her decision, for fear that he wouldn’t be able to face anyone after this ordeal. His relatives also interjected, and soon the scene turned violent, with plates and cutlery being used as weapons as guests aggressively tried to change Indira’s mind.

The woman allegedly stood by her decision.

An FIR was later filed at the Milak police station in Rampur district by the groom’s family, but it was reportedly withdrawn soon after. Local police chief RP Solanki said, “Both families have amicably resolved the matter.” He added, “The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.”",like wedding ceremony india year old jugal kishore wed year old indira varmala ceremony groom garland wife started groom suddenly epileptic fit fell ground multiple news outlet reported bride upon realising groom family kept serious medical condition furious angered state allegedly declared would happily marry harpal singh one guest wedding report state singh incidentally sister brother law singh dressed leather jacket jean completely taken aback strange situation bit hesitation declared would willingly marry indira ceremony continued substitution groom singh indira together participating varmala ceremony pandit officiating ceremony recited mantra asked new couple take seven pheras ritual hindu wedding couple make several round around sacred fire kishore meanwhile rushed hospital regained consciousness returned find fianc e already wed time india reported kishore requested indira reconsider decision fear able face anyone ordeal relative also interjected soon scene turned violent plate cutlery used weapon guest aggressively tried change indira mind woman allegedly stood decision fir later filed milak police station rampur district groom family reportedly withdrawn soon local police chief rp solanki said family amicably resolved matter added complaint withdrawn kishore family returned peace moradabad,jugal kishore wed year old indira varmala ceremony groom garland wife started groom suddenly epileptic fit fell ground multiple news outlet reported bride upon realising groom family kept serious medical condition furious angered state allegedly declared would happily marry harpal singh one guest wedding report state singh incidentally sister brother law singh dressed leather jacket jean completely taken aback strange situation bit hesitation declared would willingly marry indira ceremony continued substitution groom singh indira together participating varmal
1080,"Supporters of the militia group battling ISIS in Kobani have vehemently trashed reports that claimed Kurdish female fighter Rehana, famed for killing 100 ISIS fighters, was beheaded by the Islamic State.

A Kurdish Female fighter,who gained online celebrity status for killing '100 ISIS fighters' reportedly may have been captured and beheaded by the Islamic State fighters in Kobani.
A Kurdish Female fighter,who gained online celebrity status for killing '100 ISIS fighters' reportedly may have been captured and beheaded by the Islamic State fighters in Kobani. Twitter
Over the past week, social media has been abuzz with claims that young Kurdish female soldier Rehana was captured by the Islamic State militants and beheaded.
The Kurdish militia has neither denied nor confirmed the reports till now. The young Kurdish girl, who appears to be using pseudonym Rehana, became an online celebrity after a picture of her making a victory sign along with the caption, ""Rehana has killed more than 100 ISIS terrorists in Kobane"", was posted online by a journalist.
The female fighter for the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, came to be regarded as a symbol of hope for Kurdish supporters overnight. Several supporters of the group have now come forward with evidence to prove that Rehana has not been beheaded.
A Kurdish journalist, Rashad Abdel Qader, on his Twitter account stated that Rehana is alive. He also, however, pointed out that the claim that Rehana killed 100 ISIS fighters might be exaggerated. ""Spoke to #Rehana she's sound Re& safe. #dailymail's is not true, she didn't kill 100 #ISIS but fighting fiercely #Kobanes,""Rashad abdelQader @RashadAbdlQader tweeted.
A report in 9News claimed that citing 'unconfirmed' reports that there are speculations about Rehana being killed by ISIS as the terrorist group had posted gruesome photos of 'her' decapitated body on the social media.
Another journalist and Kurdish supporter Pawan Durani @PawanDurani noted that it was all an ISIS propaganda. ""Let #ISIS produce even a single picture of Rehana .... Propaganda and falsehood runs in their blood .... Rehana keeps hunting them,"" Durani tweeted.
?
The supporters also have posted a CNN video shot in Rojava-Kurdistan (Western Kurdistan) titled 'Is an enemy of ISIS a friend of America?' as proof that Rehana is alive. In the online discussion forums, the supporters say that the video, aired on 26 October, proves that the young Kurdish fighter is alive. The girl, who appears at 00:07- 00:08 minute in the video a holding a flag and a gun with light brown gunstock, (third from left) is Rehana.
A Mirror report also noted that Kurdish resistance had denied the ISIS claims that they have beheaded poster girl 'Rehana.' The story, however, has no official statement from any of the Kurdish militia.
The young girl, who appears to be in her twenties, has become a symbol of Kurdish resistance movement against Islamic State. Rehana is one among a few hundreds of young girls fighting for the Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which has an Independent Women's Battalion known as the YPJ.

1082,"We're at a loss for words right now. Our hearts are completely broken by this news.
17-year-old transgender teen Leelah Alcorn, also known as Joshua Alcorn, was killed after being struck by a tractor-trailer on a highway in Ohio around 2:30 a.m.
The death, however, was NOT accidental.
Leelah took her own life and detailed exactly why she was killing herself in a lengthy and heart-shattering suicide note posted to her tumblr page.
[ Related: Salvation Army Documents Show LGBTQ Discrimination ]
After explaining to her followers why exactly they were seeing the note, she revealed she took her own life because she was never accepted for being transgender.
Especially from her family.
Some of the more gut-wrenching parts of her note are as follows:
""When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me….
When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.
I formed a sort of a ""fuck you"" attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted…
I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning…
That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.
Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.""
Leelah shall not be forgotten. Her life will NOT be in vain.

1086,"Fierce clashes between jihadists and government forces near Iraqi capital

Militants understood to be attempting to enter and seize control of Baghdad

Reports of militants' proximity to Baghdad came from Canon Andrew White

He is vicar of the city's St George's Church - Iraq's only Anglican church

News comes despite ongoing Western airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq

Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital - despite ongoing Western airstrikes against the terror group.

The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday.

ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate.

Under attack: An Iraqi army soldier aims his weapon during clashes with ISIS militants in Jurf al-Sakhar - 43 miles south of Baghdad - at the weekend. ISIS militants reportedly killed 1,000 such soldiers yesterday

Peshmerga fighters hold a position at a post in the strategic Jalawla area near Baghdad during a battle with Islamic State militants at the weekend. The location is considered a gateway to the Iraqi capital

Location: The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad. But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbs

Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.

In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.

'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added.

The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.

In a message he also posted on Facebook, Canon White had said: 'The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing. If ever we needed your prayer it is now.'

The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad.

A female fighter pilot led Britain's first combat mission against Islamic State.

The woman, who has not been named, flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist-held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday.

Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, she is believed to be a weapons systems operator.

She sits in the jet's rear seat and fires the aircraft's Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs.

The airwoman, who serves with II (AC) Squadron, flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues.

A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'

The involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes amid reports that the family of Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates, who flew an F-16 jet in bombing raids against positions in Syria last week, has disowned her.

The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.

Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.

But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State

It came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil.

Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.

While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.

The mobile refineries generate up to £1.2million a day for the militants.

On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again

Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country

Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.

Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action.

The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.

Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.

'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.

Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action.

President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants

Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves'

Militants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq

The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.

Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.

UNITED STATES

The U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.

GULF STATES

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.

The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.

JORDAN

Jordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.

EGYPT

Egypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.

ISRAEL

Israel is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.

BRITAIN

Britain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.

FRANCE

France has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles — first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.

AUSTRALIA

An Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops — most of them air force personnel — are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.

BELGIUM

Six F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.

DENMARK

Denmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets — four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.

CANADA

Canada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.

GERMANY

Germany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.

GREECE

Greece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.

GEORGIA

Georgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.

HUNGARY

Hungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.

ROMANIA

Prime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.

A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.

An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center.

Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later.

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures...nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.",cnn cardiac arrest leading joan river death happened comedian personal doctor began performing biopsy vocal cord source close death investigation told cnn joan river year joan river blurb joan river passed away age take look life legendary comedienne celebrity pay tribute joan river joan river last show celebrity took social medium share thought comedian joan river death take look tribute posted twitter staff member manhattan yorkville endoscopy clinic told investigator doctor publicly identified took selfie photo procedure room river anesthesia source said river clinic scheduled endoscopy another doctor gastroenterologist dr lawrence cohen procedure intended help diagnose hoarse voice sore throat involved insertion camera throat cohen clinic medical director finished work biopsy done river without prior consent according source ear nose throat specialist certified clinic required law performed biopsy vocal cord doctor described source river personal ear nose throat physician even though licensed physician still check balance get approval practice particular place said dr arthur caplan medical ethicist new york university langone medical center investigator believe river vocal chord began swell allegedly unauthorized biopsy cutting flow oxygen lung led cardiac arrest morning august source said river rushed paramedic yorkville endoscopy new york mount sinai hospital mile away died week later yorkville endoscopy issued statement last thursday denying report vocal cord biopsy ever done clinic although federal privacy law prevented patient information released day denial issued clinic confirmed dr cohen currently performing procedure currently serving medical director source said time neither cohen ear nose throat doctor accused wrongdoing investigator clinic declined respond source comment biopsy selfie citing federal privacy law,joan river death happened comedian personal doctor began performing biopsy vocal cord source close death investigation told cnn joan river year joan river blurb joan river passed away age take look life legendary comedienne celebrity pay tribute joan river joan river last show celebrity took social medium share thought comedian joan river death take look tribute posted twitter staff member manhattan yorkville endoscopy clinic told investigator doctor publicly identified took selfie photo procedure room river anesthesia source said river clinic scheduled endos
1091,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Personal computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. reportedly plans to split itself into two separate companies by spinning off its technology services business.

The Wall Street Journal reported the pending split Sunday citing people familiar with the matter, who said the company announcement could come as soon as Monday. A spokeswoman for HP declined to comment.

The breakup would create one company that sells HP's computers and printers and a second that focuses on technology service offerings including data storage, servers and software.

The Palo Alto, California-based company has laid off thousands of employees in recent months due to flagging sales as consumers turn to mobile devices to perform basic computing chores. The shift has curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.

1100,"Wounded? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted

American war planes have reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS leaders, critically wounding their leader.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hurt in the strikes today, according to local witnesses and government sources.

Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.

Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.

Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.

A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.

Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.

Striking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.

A provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.

Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.

The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.

Iraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.

Attacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul

Separately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.

U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.

IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'

Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq

The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.

It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.

The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.

On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.

The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.

Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.

'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.

In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.

The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.

In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.

Air strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border

Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.

President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.

The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.

Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group.

He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history.

But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world.

The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous.

This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'.

But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year.

Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam.

In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends.

But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation.

American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009.

He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast.

But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly.

After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.

The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.

Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.

Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.

1102,"Argentina’s president has accepted an official Jewish godson for the first time in the country’s history.

President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.

He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.

The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.

The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.

The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.

Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received the Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”

She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle said a woman sitting two rows in front of him on the team's commercial flight was stung by a scorpion. ""The woman was a real champ,"" he said. ""She acted like it was a mosquito bite.""
The woman reported being stung on the hand, and the plane returned to the gate, where she was checked by medical personnel but declined further treatment.

Alaska Airlines stated that it is uncertain how the scorpion got on the plane but acknowledged that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where the plane was on the ground for approximately one hour.

Reached by phone aboard the plane Saturday night before the team took off for Oregon, Beavers coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.

""The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle said. ""The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.""

Alaska Airlines stated that flight attendants killed the scorpion before maintenance staff checked the plane's overhead bins. The airline planned to have an exterminator ""thoroughly check the plane"" once the flight arrived in Portland.

1111,"An elementary school suspended a boy who arrived at school last week with what he alleged was a powerful ring that appears in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy books.

Aiden Steward was suspended from Kermit Elementary School in Kermit, Texas, over a Thursday incident, The New York Daily News reported.

While speaking to another boy, 9-year-old Steward said he would able to use the One Ring and turn the fellow student invisible, according to the newspaper.

Powerful: Aiden Steward was suspended from school after telling a boy he had the One Ring and could make a student become invisible, like in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books

Speaking to The New York Daily News, father Jason Steward said 'It sounded unbelievable.'

The One Ring, as it is known, features in both Tolkien's prequel 'The Hobbit' as well as 'The Lord of the Rings.' At various points in the books, characters Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins put on the ring to make it seem as if they have vanished into thin air.

'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy follows a group of characters that set to destroy the One Ring, since it can also be used to control other peoples and kingdoms.

Steward told The New York Daily News 'Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly.'

The newspaper reported that the Steward family recently viewed 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.' Peter Jackson directed film adaptations for both 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.'

Jason Steward told the newspaper 'I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence. If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.'

Speaking to The Odessa American, he said the school considered his son's behavior to be a threat.

Principal Roxanne Greer did not comment to the website, and said 'All student stuff is confidential.'

The website reported 'The 9-year-old has been in in-school suspension for referring to another student’s skin color and got in trouble for bringing a kids’ book about pregnancy to school.'

ANTAKYA, Turkey — Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody — instead beheading three of them since July — its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed.

Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.  They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley’s body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.

If true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity — as well as the group’s cold calculation as it works to raise more cash.

At one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley’s death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands.

All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety.

One, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria’s civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra’s custody.

This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley’s family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. “They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” he said. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work “a humanity case.”

Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: “This is business.”

The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley’s body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages.

Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley’s remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal.

Of particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley’s parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son’s release. “It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,” the FSA official said. “People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.”

The FSA official described himself as the “manager” of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family.

As before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. “They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,” the FSA official said.

The Foley family had no comment for this article.

An official with the U.S. State Department said “we are seeking more information” on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea “disgusting.”

Some birds want the whole package.

None more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland, who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis.

The bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest.

Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate.

But just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead.

Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: ""The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.

""We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.

""At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

""In other words, he wasn’t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.

The zoo confirmed that they were now looking for another snowy owl to be provided but said so far other facilities were reluctant to accommodate the request after the way the owl's last partner ended up.

Konowal added: ""She may be a bit fussy but we're sure there's another owl out there who will meet her standards.""

Kei Nishikori tops annual list of highest-paid tennis players

In 2012 it looked like the tennis player’s spectacular career was winding down. Suddenly, he was back on top. People With Money reports on Sunday (January 25) that Nishikori is the highest-paid tennis player in the world, pulling in an astonishing $46 million between December 2013 and December 2014, a nearly $20 million lead over his closest competition.

People With Money’s factors

In compiling this yearly list, the magazine considers factors such as upfront pay, profit participation, residuals, endorsements and advertising work.

The Japanese tennis player has an estimated net worth of $145 million. He owes his fortune to smart stock investments, substantial property holdings, lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics. He also owns several restaurants (the “Fat Nishikori Burger” chain) in Tokyo, a Football Team (the “Matsue Angels”), has launched his own brand of Vodka (Pure Wondernishikori - Japan), and is tackling the juniors market with a top-selling perfume (With Love from Kei) and a fashion line called “Kei Nishikori Seduction”.

1124,"It’s a well-known fact that a woman’s jealousy is not something to be underestimated, and that applies all the more so to a scorned wife who has been cheated on by her husband.

In a bizarre, but true illustration of that edict, a jealous wife in China, 30-year-old Feng Lung, reported chopped her husband’s penis off with a pair of sharp scissors, not once, but twice, in order to teach him a lesson for his infidelity.

Having found out her husband was cheating on her, the woman sliced off his penis, which was reattached successfully by surgeons in Shangqiu in central China’s Henan province. When she saw her husband had sent a raunchy email to his mistress once again, she severed his member a second time.

Lung is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm to her husband, 32-year-old, Fan Lung.

The Mirror reports that surgeons were able to reattach the penis, but when the jealous wife found the email on her phone, she reportedly sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

The man ran outside the hospital to confront his wife and to find his severed penis. He was seen naked and pouring with blood in the street outside the facility.

A hospital spokesman told reporters, “The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite an extensive search by police officers at the scene, the man’s penis was never located, and authorities believe it may have been eaten by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman added, ‘The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.”",well known fact woman jealousy something underestimated applies scorned wife cheated husband bizarre true illustration edict jealous wife china year old feng lung reported chopped husband penis pair sharp scissors twice order teach lesson infidelity found husband cheating woman sliced penis reattached successfully surgeon shangqiu central china henan province saw husband sent raunchy email mistress severed member second time lung facing jail arrested causing grievous bodily harm husband year old fan lung mirror report surgeon able reattach penis jealous wife found email phone reportedly sneaked hospital room cut throwing window man ran outside hospital confront wife find severed penis seen naked pouring blood street outside facility hospital spokesman told reporter first aware happened someone came reception area say naked man beating woman outside hospital staff rushed see happening found patient blood streaming leg hitting woman stopped woman taken treatment discovered chopped penis despite extensive search police officer scene man penis never located authority believe may eaten stray dog cat hospital spokesman added man lost lot blood taken emergency surgery stable condition extremely emotionally distraught,woman sliced penis reattached successfully surgeon shangqiu central china henan province saw husband sent raunchy email mistress severed member second time lung facing jail arrested causing grievous bodily harm husband year old fan lung mirror report surgeon able reattach penis jealous wife found email phone reportedly sneaked hospital room cut throwing window man ran outside hospital confront wife find severed penis seen naked pouring blood street outside facility hospital spokesman told reporter first aware happened someone came reception area
1126,"One of the world's most wanted men ""Jihadi John"" has reportedly been wounded in an airstrike.

Jihadi John”, the man accused of executing British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning and two Americans held by Isil, may have been injured in an airstrike on an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border a week ago.

The Foreign Office said it had received reports the terrorist had been wounded but could not confirm them.

A spokesman said it did not have the resources in Syria to enable it to verify the rumours but confirmed the office had received reports.

The Mail On Sunday reported that the British-accented militant had been wounded while attending a meeting of slamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) leaders and was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, last Saturday that killed around 10 Isil commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers Mr Haines and Mr Henning.

The masked executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the Isil's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, according to the Mail's source.

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home-grown militants fighting for Isil in Syria and Iraq, and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years.

He said jihadis who have travelled to fight with extremists will not be able to return to Britain for two years.

1128,"A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad ... he really isn’t happy ... he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall.

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like ... we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.

1133,"Afghan news publication Khaama Press has reported that a woman and her family have killed 25 Taliban fighters in the western Farah province of the country. The woman, Reza Gul, was apparently acting in retaliation for the murder of her son, who was a police officer. Gul claimed to have been awoken by gunfire near her home, where her son was working at a police outpost. When she investigated the situation, she found her son dead.

""It was around 5 a.m. when my son's check post came under the attack of Taliban,"" Gul said to TOLOnews. ""When the fighting intensified, I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon, went to the check post and began shooting back.""

Many of Gul's family members joined the fight against the Taliban, which reportedly lasted several hours. Gul's husband Abdul Satar explained how the family was committed to holding off the Taliban militants from the area where the fighting began.

""My young son who was a police officer was killed in front of my eyes. I pulled aside his dead body and started fighting to defend my soil to prove that this is the soil of Malalay, the hero. I was committed to give up my life, but not my son's check post.""

General Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, Police Chief in Afghanistan's Farah province, praised the family for their efforts in holding off the Taliban with the following statement: ""We are proud of the bravery of this family and this is a saga that will be remembered for long by police and residents of Farah province.""

1135,"Claim: Mitt Romney said Michelle Obama should be called the ""First Woman,"" not the ""First Lady.""

FALSE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, January 2015]

Did Mitt Romney make the statement noted below on the Laura Ingraham show on 1/12/14. Was this the exact statement made? Was it taken out of context? or...?

""It's false advertising to call Mrs. Obama the First Lady. First Woman, maybe, but certainly not a lady. Ann Romney is an actual lady.""

Origins: On 13 January 2015, the Facebook group ""Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want to Get Off"" posted an image of Mitt Romney along with a quote attributed to him about First Lady Michelle Obama:

The image alleges Romney made the displayed comment about referring to Michelle Obama as the ""First Woman"" rather than the ""First Lady"" during an appearance on the Laura Ingraham Show on 12 January 2014. A search of that radio program's guest archives , however, shows the former presidential candidate was not a guest on the show on that date. Romney's purported comments about the First Lady are also suspiciously missing from political blogs and major newspapers.

Furthermore, the ""Stop the World"" Facebook group has garnered a reputation for attributing fictitious quotes to conservative politicians. On 27 November 2014, that group posted a dubious diatribe attributed to Congresswoman Michele Bachmann about the ""red Indian"" and Thanksgiving, and on 1 January 2015 it claimed Sarah Palin had made offensive comments about ""white privilege.""

While the Facebook page does not contain a disclaimer labeling it a satirical site, it is clear ""Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want to Get Off"" should not be considered a trusted source of political information.

1138,"A transgender teenager who committed suicide by walking in front of a tractor trailer in Ohio left a heartbreaking letter in which she blamed her religious parents.

Leelah Alcorn, 17, died in the early hours of Sunday on highway I-71 in Warren County, Ohio, a few miles from her family home.

The high school student left a poignant suicide note accusing her devout Christian parents of refusing to acknowledge her gender and forbidding her from transitioning.

Tragedy: Transgender teenager Leelah Alcorn left a poignant suicide note on her tumblr account, blaming her Christian parents' refusal to acknowledge her gender for her death

The suicide note was posted on Leelah's tumblr account through scheduled publishing just a few hours after her death.

The note begins: 'If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.'

Leelah, from Kings Mill, Ohio, writes that although she was born a boy, she began identifying as a girl at the age of four.

'When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was.

'I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.'

Leelah, 17, was born a boy called Joshua, but despite telling her parents at an early age that she was trans, they replied that she was 'wrong' and sent her to therapy

The 17-year-old high school student wrote in her suicide note that despite identifying as a girl from the age of four, her devout Christian parents refused to allow her to transition

Leelah goes on to reveal that her parents refused to allow her to transition and instead took her to 'Christian therapists' who told her that she was 'selfish and wrong'.

'I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock.

'Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them.

'They wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.'

'On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.'

Leelah then adds: 'I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself.

Local media and Leelah's former high school in Kings Mill have reported on the tragic news using her birth name Joshua.

Leelah's mother Carla Wood Alcorn posted a tribute to her child on her Facebook, but referred to Leelah as her 'son', used her birth name, and made no mention of a suicide.

The disregard for Leelah's wishes to be identified as a girl has angered many in the LGBT community, and a Facebook group calling for Justice for Leelah Alcorn has been set up.

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.

So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.

At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn’t actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Goodbye,

1142,"Ever since allegations against Bill Cosby resurfaced, fans who were in denial all these years have had to embrace the fifth stage of grief-acceptance.

As difficult as it is to imagine the vibrant-coloured-sweater wearing father figure -- who made us laugh through childhood all the way into adulthood -- could be a serial rapist, it is hard to ignore the latest accuser, Raven Symone who stole everyone's heart as little Olivia Kendall in ""The Cosby Show"".

According to Hip-Hop Hangover, former child actor Symone told TMZ officials that she too had been drugged and raped by Cosby following the wrapping up of ""The Cosby Show"". The site claims that there were even rumours about Cosby disallowing Symone from appearing in the last season of the show initially and later abruptly changing his mind.

According to a statement from her lawyer, ""...we among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed. There was no monetary compensation that made my client keep quiet, but more so the respect for Mr. Cosby. Well that respect has come to an end. And what we thought was a mistake or anomaly has surfaced to become a lifestyle. We will be pursuing damages that are not going to be disclosed at this time.""


Bill Cosby with kids who appeared on ""The Cosby Show"". Cosby has been accused of rape by Raven Symone, who was a child star in the popular TV show.Reuters
Symone's allegations strengthen the accusations of various other women including music industry publicist and journalist Joan Tarshis, actress Barbara Bowman and 15 others.

In one of the most revealing interviews, Tarshis told CNN that when she was just 19 years old, Cosby took her to his bungalow and gave her a drink, shortly after which she passed out. The next thing she remembers is him removing her underwear, she revealed. She went on to explain she used to ""idolise"" Cosby at the time and no one would have believed her anyway, which is why she refrained from coming out with the truth then.

""I assumed I was not the only girl that he was doing this with, but who's going to believe me? Bill Cosby, the all-American dad, the all-American husband, Mr Jell-O, the guy everybody loves. Who would believe me? They would probably think I was out to get something,"" Tarshis said.



Bowman, who also gave an all-revealing interview of her experiences with Cosby told CNN that she was thrilled at having him mentor her; a position he misused. One night while at his apartment, she passed out although she only had a single glass of wine.

Her next memory is of doubling over a toilet bowl in her underwear and a men's t-shirt, as Cosby held her hair back. She went on to add that throughout their working relationship the drug-facilitated rapes continued.

In an article for The Washington Post Bowman wrote, ""as a teenager, I tried to convince myself I had imagined it. I even tried to rationalize it: Bill Cosby was going to make me a star and this was part of the deal.""

During their last sexual encounter, Bowman says she tried to wrestle from his grasp, ""until he eventually gave up, angrily called me 'a baby' and sent me home to Denver.""



Meanwhile ""The View"" co-host Whoopie Goldberg expressed doubts over Bowman's accusations and invited her to come on the program and answer a few questions directly.

""Quite honestly, you know, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something, it doesn't matter now... I have a lot of questions for the lady. Maybe she'll come on,"" Goldberg said.

Many women have alleged rape against Cosby since mid 2000s, however it was a 2-minute routine performed by comedian Hannibal Burress that brought it back to limelight. He said, ""Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches,"" Buress said. ""I've done this bit on stage and people think I'm making it up.... when you leave here, Google 'Bill Cosby rape.' That sh** has more results than 'Hannibal Buress'"".

While Cosby still remains silent on the rape accusations against him, a 1969 stand-up routine, ironically titled ""It's True! It's True!"" has him explaining how as a kid he had heard about a wonder drug -- ""Spanish Fly"" -- that would make a girl go crazy once it was put into her drink. He then goes on to speak of his interest in such a drug, which could have been a prelude to Cosby living his fantasy of stripping women of their ability to say ""no"".",ever since allegation bill cosby resurfaced fan denial year embrace fifth stage grief acceptance difficult imagine vibrant coloured sweater wearing father figure made u laugh childhood way adulthood could serial rapist hard ignore latest accuser raven symone stole everyone heart little olivia kendall cosby show according hip hop hangover former child actor symone told tmz official drugged raped cosby following wrapping cosby show site claim even rumour cosby disallowing symone appearing last season show initially later abruptly changing mind according statement lawyer among many others tired medium worshipping praising man past terrible unbelievable client raven symone also ready tell side story side kept quiet threat blackballed monetary compensation made client keep quiet respect mr cosby well respect come end thought mistake anomaly surfaced become lifestyle pursuing damage going disclosed time bill cosby kid appeared cosby show cosby accused rape raven symone child star popular tv show reuters symone allegation strengthen accusation various woman including music industry publicist journalist joan tarshis actress barbara bowman others one revealing interview tarshis told cnn year old cosby took bungalow gave drink shortly passed next thing remembers removing underwear revealed went explain used idolise cosby time one would believed anyway refrained coming truth assumed girl going believe bill cosby american dad american husband mr jell guy everybody love would believe would probably think get something tarshis said bowman also gave revealing interview experience cosby told cnn thrilled mentor position misused one night apartment passed although single glass wine next memory doubling toilet bowl underwear men shirt cosby held hair back went add throughout working relationship drug facilitated rape continued article washington post bowman wrote teenager tried convince imagined even tried rationalize bill cosby going make star part deal last sexual encounter bowman say tried wrestle grasp eventually gave angrily called baby sent home denver meanwhile view co host whoopie goldberg expressed doubt bowman accusation invited come program answer question directly quite honestly know look sorry side people allege something matter lot question lady maybe come goldberg said many woman alleged rape cosby since mid however minute routine performed comedian hannibal burress brought back limelight said yeah rape woman bill cosby turn crazy couple notch buress said done bit stage people think making leave google bill cosby rape sh result hannibal buress cosby still remains silent rape accusation stand routine ironically titled true true explaining kid heard wonder drug spanish fly would make girl go crazy put drink go speak interest drug could prelude cosby living fantasy stripping woman ability say,cosby resurfaced fan denial year embrace fifth stage grief acceptance difficult imagine vibrant coloured sweater wearing father figure made u laugh childhood way adulthood could serial rapist hard ignore latest accuser raven symone stole everyone heart little olivia kendall cosby show according hip hop hangover former child actor symone told tmz official drugged raped cosby following wrapping cosby show site claim even rumour cosby disallowing s
1146,"An Egyptian man has reportedly delivered a financial blow to the Islamic State (Isis) by becoming ""emir"" of its alms department and then fleeing with almost one million US dollars to Turkey.

Abu Obeida (or Ubaidah) al-Masri, secretary of the Zakat (charity) bureau and treasurer of IS Syrian branch, eloped with the funds amounting to ""billion Syrian pounds"" which have been collected by his department in Deir Ez Zour province, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper reported, citing Syrian Press Center news site.

According to some rumours, IS militants have issued an order to stop recruiting Egyptian jihadists because of the incident.

The claim could not be independently verified by IBTimes UK.

IS imposed a Zakat tax on merchants and industrialists in the areas under its control in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Isis ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

The merchants told the militants that they are already paying money to the poor families, but IS responded that those families should report to the Zakat bureau instead.

""The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,"" IS reportedly said.

The Zakat is the third Pillar of Islam and refers to the systematic giving of 2.5% of one's wealth each year to benefit the poor. The rate only applies to cash, gold and silver and commercial items.

1147,"Version 8.2 of Apple's iOS mobile operating system could launch as soon as Monday with new and improved health features in tow. That's the same day the company is expected to unveil more details on its Apple Watch.

The maker of the iPhone and iPad mobile gadgets was close to releasing iOS 8.2 to the public earlier, blog Boy Genius Report said on Thursday, but instead decided to push out one final build to employees and testers. The change log for that build reveals several new features and enhancements in the health department as well as a host of bug fixes, according to BGR.

The Apple Watch faces an increasingly competitive market already crowded with devices from other players. To entice a wide range of buyers, Apple designed its first wearable as both a smartwatch and a health and fitness monitor. So the health features baked into iOS 8 need to be solid if Apple hopes to capture the fitness crowd.

Based on the change log, the new and improved health features in iOS 8.2:

add the ability to select the unit of measurement for body temperature, weight, height, distance and blood glucose,
improve stability when dealing with large amounts of data,
include the ability to add and visualize workout sessions from third-party apps,
address an issue that may have prevented users from adding a photo in Medical ID,
fix units for vitamins and minerals,
fix an issue where health data wouldn't refresh after changes in data source order,
fix an issue where some graphics showed no data values, and
add a privacy setting that enables turning off tracking of steps, distance and flights climbed.
But iOS 8.2 is also designed as a bug squasher.

Life hasn't exactly been easy for Apple's iOS 8 since it launched last September. The initial version carried a few bugs that were supposed to be resolved a week later in iOS 8.0.1. But that edition came with even more bugs, prompting Apple to quickly pull it and launch 8.0.2. Since then Apple has rolled out versions 8.1, 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, all with some enhancements and bug fixes.

The bugs and multiple releases may account for the sluggish adoption of iOS 8, which has trailed that of its predecessor but is finally up to 75 percent of all devices that visited the App Store as of last Monday.

According to BGR, the bug fixes:

address an issue in Maps that prevented navigating to some favorite locations,
address an issue where the last word in a quick reply message wasn't autocorrected,
fix an issue where duplicate iTunes purchased content could prevent iCloud restore from completing,
resolve an issue where some music or playlists didn't sync from iTunes to the Music app,
fix an issue where deleted audiobooks sometimes remained on the device,
resolve an issue that could prevent call audio from routing to car speakers while using Siri Eyes Free,
fix a Bluetooth calling issue where no audio is heard until the call is answered,
fix a timezone issue where Calendar events appear in GMT,
address an issue that caused certain events in a custom reoccurring meeting to drop from Exchange calendar,
fix a certificate error that prevented configuring an Exchange account behind a third-party gateway,
fix an issue that could cause an organizer's Exchange meeting notes to be overwritten, and
resolve an issue that prevented some Calendar events from automatically showing as ""busy"" after accepting an invite.
The update also promises greater stability for Mail, Music, the Flyover feature in Maps, VoiceOver reliability, and Connectivity with Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.

1150,"Gwen Korovin, Joan Rivers’s personal ear, nose and throat doctor who allegedly performed an unauthorized procedure on the late comedian while she was under anesthesia for an endoscopy, has denied taking a selfie with Rivers while she was in the procedure room.

According to a report by CNN, Korovin “categorically denies” taking the selfie, and also denies performing the unauthorized procedure on Rivers. Days ago, CNN reported that clinic employees told investigators the doctor took the photo and performed said procedure.

Said CNN:

CNN’s source close to the investigation also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin’s procedure room selfie. Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers “will think this is funny” or “would love this” as she took the photo, the source said. Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy on Aug. 28 to find out why she had a sore throat and her voice was hoarse. CNN’s sources maintain Rivers stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell, and she went into cardiac arrest. Rivers died Sept. 4 at age 81 after going on life support at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Previous reports stated Rivers stopped breathing after a botched attempt at a biopsy. CNN is now reporting that she stopped breathing after Korovin attempted a second laryngoscopy following an endoscopy. Korovin also performed a laryngoscopy prior to the endoscopy.

Here’s the letter Korovin’s lawyer sent to the network:

Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city’s most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice.

1151,"The calendar may have just flipped to 2015, but Saudi Arabia is partying like it's 1755.

The Daily Mail reports that Saudia, the kingdom's national airline, will introduce gender-segregated flights. Except close relatives, men and women flying on Saudia can reportedly look forward to assigned seating based on their naughty bits.

The discriminatory practice stems from multiple complaints lodged by male fliers who were unhappy that other men were allowed to sit next to their wives and female family members. Some men also objected to the conduct of a female flight attendant, which they deemed too ""flirty.""

The change was first reported by Gulf media outlets, according to the Daily Mail. ""There are solutions to this problem,"" Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told Ajel, a Saudi Arabian newspaper. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The airline will apparently include orders for flight-booking staff on the ground to make sure men and women are separated, Emirates247 reports. According to Mashable, however, a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers.

Saudia already follows a variety of religious practices onboard, including the prohibition of alcohol and pork dishes and reading a Quran verse before takeoff. The airline also chooses not to hire Saudi women to work as cabin crew.

Similar complaints have been heard on flights traveling to Israel. In September, a flight headed to Tel Aviv from New York was delayed because several ultra-Orthodox Jewish men wouldn't sit next to women who weren't family members; more recently, a Delta flight was delayed for half an hour because ultra-Orthodox men refused to be seated next to women, and other passengers wouldn't change seats with them.

One Chicago woman started a petition on Change.org to stop the practice of forcing women to change seats, arguing that ""one person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.""

She's right, and the same could be said of discriminatory rules like those that Saudia reportedly plans to introduce. But given its already troubled history of the treatment of women — it was ranked the third-worst country in the Arab world for women — these new guidelines unfortunately appear to be more of the same.

The girl, whose name is known to African Eye News Service (AENS) but cannot be published because she is under age, attacked Humphrey Khoza with battery acid while he was drinking beers with friends at a tavern in Cork village near Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on January 17.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn’t realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,"" said Khoza.

Khoza said he had been dating the schoolgirl since December.

""We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still
don’t know how it got onto social media,"" he said.

In the viral video that AENS has seen to verify the claims, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, who was in her school uniform, to the bed. She appeared not to notice that she was being filmed while they had sex.

The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.

He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but doesn't see the point.

""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won’t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,"" said Khoza.

1186,"On October 27, rumors began to spread on social media that a Kurdish female fighter known by the pseudonym Rehana may have been beheaded by Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Kobani.

Dubbed the ""poster child for Kobani female warriors,"" Rehana, a fighter in the Kurdish YPJ (People's Protection Units) militia, captured the public's imagination after her photograph was circulated on the internet. The image of Rehana making a ""victory sign"" was retweeted hundreds of times, along with the claim that she was singlehandedly responsible for killing over a hundred ISIS militants.

While there has been no confirmation of Rehana's death, several news outlets, including Australia's 9News reported that she may have been beheaded, citing a graphic image of a beheaded Kurdish female fighter that had been shared on pro-IS social media accounts.

There is no way to verify if the image -- which shows an IS militant holding the head of a decapitated woman — is genuine, or if it is Rehana. However, the same gruesome photograph has been circulating since at least October 5 on pro-ISIS accounts.

The fact that the claims and rumors of Rehana's possible brutal killing have garnered so much attention is testament to the enormous public interest in female fighters in the Syrian Kurdish YPJ and Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga militias.

Reports have dubbed the women ""badass"", ""battle-hardened"" and ""fanatical"" fighters. The interest is unsurprising: these are all-female fighters waging war on ISIS militants, who are not only a formidable military force but whose repressive and violent Islamist ideology is in stark contrast to any progressive, feminist philosophy that allows women to go to war.

Throughout the 40-day siege of Kobani, images of female Kurdish fighters have circulated widely on social media:

With a gun and a guitar... Kurdish female fighters in the streets of #Kobane #KobaneResistance! pic.twitter.com/fD1tWCwNht

This tweet included a photograph of Rehanna:

#Airdrop2Kobane because Kurdish female fighters of the Women Protection Unit rather die than living under ISIS rule pic.twitter.com/UygfWa52DE

The images of young Kurdish women fighting for Kobani has also inspired artistic expression:

Female fighters of #YPG in #Kobane ! pic.twitter.com/k5n3v3Vnva

The widespread interest in Kurdish female fighters and their battle against IS militants in Kobani has given rise to a number of rumors, one of which — that ISIS militants are afraid of being killed by women soldiers because if a woman kills a muhajid (jihadi fighter), he won't go to Paradise — has become ingrained in the popular narrative about IS and the Kurds.

However, the source of the rumor was not an ISIS scholar but a female Kurdish fighter.

Many of the news and magazine reports about the Kurdish women militias lauded these fighters as ""inspirational"" feminists.

Yet are all-female Kurdish fighters really a sign that the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) -- or wider Kurdish society — is a bastion of feminism?

The Marxist-inspired PKK boasts one of the largest numbers of armed women militias in the world. According to the BBC, women have been integral to the Kurdish movement since the PKK's founding in 1978. At that time, it was strongly influenced by Marxist-Leninist ideas.

However, the story of the PKK's all-female-militias is complex.

The PKK was one way for Kurdish women to advance themselves. (Norwegian academic Dr Kariane Westrheim told the BBC that Kurdish women had ""struggled hard to get their voices heard."")

Wladimir van Wilgenburg, a Middle East analyst with the Jamestown Foundation specializing in Kurdish politics, says the hype over ""feminist"" Kurdish female militias is ""part of sensationalist reporting.""

""There is a feminist tradition with the Kurdistan Workers Party based on the ideology of [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan. It's not much different from other Marxist rebel movements that have female fighters, but what makes it unique is that, in general, there are not a lot of political movements having female fighters. Especially not the Islamist ones,"" van Wilgenburg told RFE/RL.

In an op-ed in Turkey's Hurriyet News (Turkey considers the PKK to be a terrorist organization, as does the United States and the EU), Berfu Kiziltan of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva offers an even less rosy picture of the PKK.

According to Kiziltan, while the PKK has historically recruited womenas well as men, some of the recruitment has been by force. More than half of the PKK's suicide attacks in Turkey have been carried out by women, because it was easier for them to evade security, and because suicide bombings allowed women a way to ""prove they could be as fierce as their male counterparts,"" she writes.

At least one Kurdish female fighter has also carried out suicide bombings in Kobani.

Earlier this month, Kurdish fighter Arin Mirkan reportedly killed 10 IS militants when she blew herself up outside the northern Syrian town, the first report of a Kurdish female fighter carrying out a suicide attack in Syria.

1188,"BlackBerry has interested Lenovo for some time, and it seems like the Chinese company is gearing up once more to attempt an acquisition

BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) (TSE:BB) could be an acquisition target for Lenovo, says a report from Benzinga, citing a source familiar with the news. According to the report, the Chinese group will make an offer of $15 per share to the BlackBerry as early as this week, with the deal finally getting done at around $18 per share.

BlackBerry

Lenovo plans smart devices

On Wednesday, Lenovo stated that it is planning to launch its internet-based smart devices on Apr. 1, 2015. Also it was reported that the company will operate under a separate name and brand. A BlackBerry spokesperson told Benzinga that the company would not respond to rumors or speculations, and a Lenovo spokesperson was not available for the comment.

Lenovo CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013 that the Canadian smartphone maker was under consideration from the company. However, BlackBerry declined any such possibility that time. Only last year, the government banned a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo due to some national security issues.



BlackBerry shipment estimates lowered

Recently analyst Todd Coupland at CIBC World Markets speculated that the estimated shipment volume for BlackBerry devices for the third and fourth quarters would be weak. Coupland added though that the initial demand for the BlackBerry Passport is encouraging compared to modest expectations. Coupland noted that on Google Trends, there was an increased search interest for the device that was similar to the BB10’s number two devices. Also the Canadian company sold an unexpected 200,000 units of the Passport on the very first day of its launch.

Coupland said, “Shipments, however, are being held back by supply constraints for unique screens and keyboards that will limit any upside in fiscal Q3.”

According to the analyst, demand for BB7 and Z30 devices of BlackBerry is going down, therefore, shipment forecasts for BlackBerry devices have been revised down from 2.3 million units to 1.6 million units for the third quarter. Additionally, for the fourth-quarter, his shipment estimate is down from 2.5 million units to 1.5 million.

BlackBerry CEO John Chen is expecting total shipments to hit 10 million units annually by 2017. Coupland says that the company still has a lot to do to revive its position in hardware before it can achieve its target and expects the company to ship only 6.8 million units in 2016 and 2017.",blackberry interested lenovo time seems like chinese company gearing attempt acquisition blackberry ltd nasdaq bbry tse bb could acquisition target lenovo say report benzinga citing source familiar news according report chinese group make offer per share blackberry early week deal finally getting done around per share blackberry lenovo plan smart device wednesday lenovo stated planning launch internet based smart device apr also reported company operate separate name brand blackberry spokesperson told benzinga company would respond rumor speculation lenovo spokesperson available comment lenovo cfo wong wai ming said january canadian smartphone maker consideration company however blackberry declined possibility time last year government banned potential blackberry deal lenovo due national security issue blackberry shipment estimate lowered recently analyst todd coupland cibc world market speculated estimated shipment volume blackberry device third fourth quarter would weak coupland added though initial demand blackberry passport encouraging compared modest expectation coupland noted google trend increased search interest device similar bb number two device also canadian company sold unexpected unit passport first day launch coupland said shipment however held back supply constraint unique screen keyboard limit upside fiscal q according analyst demand bb z device blackberry going therefore shipment forecast blackberry device revised million unit million unit third quarter additionally fourth quarter shipment estimate million unit million blackberry ceo john chen expecting total shipment hit million unit annually coupland say company still lot revive position hardware achieve target expects company ship million unit,chinese company gearing attempt acquisition blackberry ltd nasdaq bbry tse bb could acquisition target lenovo say report benzinga citing source familiar news according report chinese company gearing attempt acquisition blackberry ltd nasdaq bbry tse bb could acquisition target lenovo say report benzinga citing source familiar news according report chinese group make offer per
1189,"Microsoft -- the parent company of the Xbox and Windows brands -- is apparently ""in serious discussions"" to purchase Mojang, according to The Wall Street Journal. Mojang, of course, is best-known for its massively popular Minecraft series.

WSJ cites ""a person with knowledge of the matter"" in their story, and says the valuation of Mojang could be more than $2 billion. Microsoft and Mojang both declined to comment to WSJ; we've reached out to Mojang for additional comment.

Mojang, founded by developer Markus Persson in 2009, has two still-unreleased games in development -- Cobalt and Scrolls -- as well as Minecraft, which it's still endlessly iterating on with updates and ports.
Microsoft's investment to purchase Mojang, if true, would give the company complete control over not only the studio's upcoming games, but it's all-important, insanely lucrative Minecraft series. As of June, the game has sold over 54 million copies, and has actually sold best on consoles, which bodes well for Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

Minecraft launched in late 2011 on PC, and we loved it. It later migrated to iOS and Android before coming to Xbox 360 in 2012, where it sold like gangbusters. A PlayStation 3 iteration launched late in 2013, which we also loved, and the game just came to both Xbox One and PlayStation 4. You can read our review here. The only other known, upcoming version of the game -- for Vita -- is due out in the coming couple of months.

1191,"Since the program’s inception, Michelle Obama’s Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act has offended the sensibilities of the entire nation.

Conservatives found the program to be invasive, thrusting D.C.’s hand into local education matters. Educators found the program wasted enormous amounts of food and money. Parents found the lunches far too light to be considered “meals.” And school children everywhere took to the Internet with pictures of the gruesome dishes the program sloshed onto their cafeteria trays every day.

Those pictures did massive amounts of damage to Michelle’s pet program, but now an even worse PR disaster rears its head. This week the U.K. Daily Mail ran pictures of what other countries feed their school children. The comparison is stark … and humiliating for the United States.

The “meal” above featuring an orange slice, a puddle of either apple sauce or a pulverized slice of peach or pear, and what looks like lumpy chipped beef without the toast is one of the dishes that complies with Michelle’s totalitarian program.

Compare this insult to parents, palettes and taxpayers alike with what other nations feed their school children. The contrast below is striking to say the least.

There you have it. Those are samples from a bankrupt Mediterranean nation, a former second-world nation, a financially stricken European nation, a favela-ridden South American nation and some of our other allies.

Every single one manages to feed their schoolchildren in a more thorough, appetizing and seemingly humane way than the world’s lone remaining superpower (H/T U.K. Daily Mail).

What Michelle Obama has done to our children’s food is a national disgrace, and she should hang her head in shame.

1193,"Saudia Airlines, the state-run airline of Saudi Arabia, does not have plans to separate passengers based on gender, according to an airline source quoted in stories claiming the opposite.

Several Gulf area and UK media outlets reported that the airline planned to seat unrelated men and women after receiving complaints.

“There are solutions to this problem,"" Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, an assistant marketing manager for Saudia, was quoted as saying to Saudi Arabia daily Ajel. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

Although Ajel reported that those solutions would include separating men and women unless they are closely related, the source of the quote said the story was fabricated, and that his quote was taken out of context.

The rumor was perhaps more believable after an incident last week, when ultra-Orthodox Jewish men delayed an Israel-bound Delta flight because they refused to sit next to female passengers.

And Saudi Arabia has persistent gender disparities: The World Economic Forum ranked Saudi Arabia 127th out of 136 countries for women's rights in its Global Gender Gap Report in 2013.

There are restrictions on women — for example, they are not permitted to drive in the country — however there have also been signs of recent change. Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah announced in 2011 that women would be able to vote in 2015 elections.

Saudia is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.

1194,"The shipment of Apple Watch, the most anticipated wearable device featuring iOS-based user interface designed for smaller devices, will commence in March. KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo, considered to be a credible source for Apple related news and rumours has revealed this to MacRumors. Ming Chi Kuo expects that Apple might reveal few more details related to Apple Watch's battery life and the pre-orders, prior to its official launch. While most hardware components of Apple Watch will mark high shipments during the same quarter, other key components are expected to see low production rate, which could result in a constrained supply, Kuo believes. A total of 2.8 million Apple Watch units, which come in three distinct collections such as Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sports and Apple Watch Edition, units are expected in Q1 2015. The iPhone shipment for the first quarter is likely to be more than 61 million units, whereas for iPad it is 10 million units. 12in MacBook Air  Kuo asserts that the upcoming 12in MacBook Air could make its international debut in the first quarter, with high resolution Retina display and a low-powered Intel Core M processor. Besides this, it is expected to be the first Apple product to take advantage of new reversible USB Type C connector for charging.

1199,"A Grade 4 student was reportedly suspended from his Texas school after he threatened to make another boy disappear with his Lord of the Rings replica ring.

Jason Steward told the Odessa American that his son had seen The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies last weekend and got himself a replica of fabled One Ring.

Steward said his son wore it to Kermit Elementary School, where he told another boy the ring's magic could make him disappear.

Steward said the principal told him no threats would be tolerated — even magical ones.

The school wouldn't comment on the suspension, citing privacy concerns.

The boy has been in trouble before, his father said — once for referring to another child's skin colour, and once for bringing a children's book to school that had a chapter about pregnancy.

But the dad assured the New York Daily News the nine-year-old Tolkien enthusiast is not dangerous.

1204,"The anonymous note between office colleagues was posted on Facebook

It was shared from a New Zealand radio station and went viral

It is a hilarious note war between the colleagues over a stolen sandwich

The notes were posted on a fridge door in an office kitchen

A frustrated office worker's request to a colleague to stop pinching their lunch from the fridge has sparked a hilarious note war between the two.

The A4 notes pinned to the fridge door of an office kitchen have gone viral on a New Zealand radio Facebook page due to the hilarious content contained on them.

What starts as a simple request to the 'turkey and Swiss on Rye' owner to the 'sandwich thief' to stop stealing their lunch, soon turns into an anonymous office stand-off with several demands being traded.

The passive-aggressive note which started the war between the two office workers

The first demand from the anonymous thief, which infuriates the sandwich thief even further

A return threat from the owner of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' that they will bring HR in to conversation

'To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (Turkey and Swiss with mayo on Rye)...' the first of many passive-aggressive notes reads.

'Stop stealing other people's property!!!'

What follows is one of several demands from the thief to pay $10 and leave it in the fridge in return for the person's lunch - or they'll 'never see it undigested again.'

The thief, a man, includes a picture of him holding a portion of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' - one of many he posts picture with him holding it to prove he has it in his possession.

Refusing to take the sandwich owner's advice to be a 'responsible adult' seriously, he further infuriates 'Turkey and Swiss on rye' who threatens the thief with human resources action.

The conversation loses its professionalism along the way and becomes increasingly personal, before 'Tina from HR' wades in with a note to the sandwich owner.

'Please return the sandwich to the owner and we won't investigate this any further,' Tina writes.

To which the thief replies: 'Buy me a pizza.'

Tina responds: 'No'

The image of the sandwich thief threatening to continue devouring the person's lunch if they don't put $10 in the fridge

The defeated sandwich owner asks...

More evidence that the man is in possession of the sandwich

The owner follows through on his threat to contact HR and a letter from Tina appears on the fridge door

The thief takes his demands to the top

Who would have thought? Tina refuses

The three-way dialogue continues until the thief posts a lengthy note with an image of an empty plate proving that he has devoured the sandwich in full.

It is at this point the alleged thief, 'Francis', is finally found out when Tina traces the printed A4 sheets back to his account.

'Francis we checked the office printer queue and traced the requests back to your desk. Could you please see me at your earliest convenience.'

The hilarious note war winds up with Francis grovelling for his job with a simple one-line request pleading not to be fired.

'Please don't fire me.'

The thief rubs it in even more

1207,"The Islamic State (ISIS) is harvesting organs of its victims to finance its terrorist army, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations said Tuesday.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” said Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim, referring to the U.N. Security Council. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.” Here is how he described bodies as missing kidneys and showing marks of surgical incisions:
When we discover mass graves, we look at the bodies. Some of those bodies are killed by bullets, some of them by knives. But when you find pieces of the back is [sic] missing and the kidneys is [sic] missing, you will wonder what it is.
His report reveals that the ISIS never fails to shock the world. He declared that the ISIS executed a dozen doctors in Mosul because they refused to cooperate to remove organs.

Alhakim is replacing outgoing ambassador Nikolay Mladenov, who told the Security Council, “It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day.”

The ISIS controls territory that includes the airports in Mosul in Iraq and Aleppo in Syria, giving it the ability to ship human organs to traffickers.

He said IS has access to airports in Mosul and in the Syrian city of Aleppo, from which it could transport the illicit organs to international middlemen and buyers.

No less shocking is that the Western world is treating the report as if it did not know months ago that the Islamic State has resorted to harvesting human organs.

Al-Monitor reported last December 5:
The third funding source [besides oil sales and taxes on residents] was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling.
Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

The Western world, not least of all the Obama administration, chose not to disseminate the information in hopes of postponing the inevitable – a declaration of war on the ISIS.

1209,"South African police have been accused of not doing enough to crack down on a sick new sport that replaces fighting dogs with children.

Kids as young as nine-years-old are getting onto all fours and scratching and biting other children, growling and snarling in the process.

And in a bizarre twist, the winners of the fights are rewarded just like a real dogs by allowing them to have sex with other children.

Although the sex act is only simulated, it has shocked the country after it was revealed in local media to become a regular happening in the district of Ekurhuleni in the South African city of Johannesburg.

Inspector Wendy Willson from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) confirmed that they had started an investigation after reports that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries.

Teachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play, while other pupils were placing bets on who would win. She said the activity had developed among children who had been watching real dogfights at the weekends with their parents and were mimicking the action at school. It is not clear if the children take part in the sport due to peer pressure or under encouragement of adults.

Willson said she had witnessed the children getting down on all fours – barking, growling, biting and scratching each other.

She said: ""They rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury.""

She also recorded a video of one fight which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example.

She said: ""It’s incredibly disturbing that young children are being forced to be involved in this.""

Willson said it was unclear what role adults played in the new sport but she said it was clear that children had only become involved in the dogfights after witnessing the real thing.

She said she had been shocked by the discovery, adding: ""I have never seen this before. I searched for examples of children being used like this internationally and came up with nothing.""

The regional Department of Education said it had been made aware of these allegations early last year.

Spokeswoman Phumla Sekhonyane said: ""The department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention."" She did not explain why they have not contacted the police nor why, although concerns had been raised, nothing significant had been done to help the children.

Director of child abuse charity Teddy Bear Clinic Shaheda Omar said it was the first time she had ever heard of the dog-fighting role-play taking place.

Omar said: ""I have seen cases where children violate animals and show no remorse, but never this.

""These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I’m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialised into that behaviour.

""Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.""

The situation needed urgent, systemic intervention, and different departments needed to get involved to stop the abuse and the children’s behaviour, she said.

Omar said: ""If nothing is done, this will become a breeding ground for sociopaths.""",south african police accused enough crack sick new sport replaces fighting dog child kid young nine year old getting onto four scratching biting child growling snarling process bizarre twist winner fight rewarded like real dog allowing sex child although sex act simulated shocked country revealed local medium become regular happening district ekurhuleni south african city johannesburg inspector wendy willson special investigation unit national council spcas nspca confirmed started investigation report pupil returning breaktime torn clothing injury teacher discovered child fighting dog fighting role play pupil placing bet would win said activity developed among child watching real dogfight weekend parent mimicking action school clear child take part sport due peer pressure encouragement adult willson said witnessed child getting four barking growling biting scratching said rip play aggressive enough cause injury also recorded video one fight much tamer really happening child asked provide example said incredibly disturbing young child forced involved willson said unclear role adult played new sport said clear child become involved dogfight witnessing real thing said shocked discovery adding never seen searched example child used like internationally came nothing regional department education said made aware allegation early last year spokeswoman phumla sekhonyane said department contacted spca request intervention explain contacted police although concern raised nothing significant done help child director child abuse charity teddy bear clinic shaheda omar said first time ever heard dog fighting role play taking place omar said seen case child violate animal show remorse never child used like cog machine sure sort reward offered socialised behaviour violence begets violence child learning adult situation needed urgent systemic intervention different department needed get involved stop abuse child behaviour said omar said nothing done become breeding ground sociopath,police say enough crack sick new sport replaces fighting dog child kid young nine year old getting onto four scratching biting child growling snarling process bizarre twist winner fight rewarded like real dog allowing sex child . south african police accused enough crack sick new sport replaces fighting dog child kid kid young nine year old getting onto four scratching biting child growling snarling process bizarre twist winner fight rewarded like real dog allowing sex child although sex act simulated shocked country revealed

1216,"That North Korean leader is a mysterious fellow. Quite apart from the mandatory hairstyle, the rapid weight gain, and the did-he-or-didn’t-he execution games, lately, the supreme leader has kinda just… disappeared. The usually spotlight-loving head of state is not in the press, not at events, and not at meetings. That’s right, Kim Jong-un has been missing for several weeks, and no one’s quite sure why.

The last time that Kim made a public appearance was Sept. 3, when he went to a concert with his wife. Since then, the media hasn’t heard a peep from the dictator. According to the AP, on Thursday he didn’t even show up to the reopening of North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly, a super high-level meeting at the Pyongyang parliament. It’s the first time he’s missed such an important event since 2011, when his father died.

There are a lot of questions one could ask about the North Korean dictator. Does he really rule the country, or is he simply under the thumb of the intriguing Organization and Guidance Department? Does he really love theme parks and brutal prison camps simultaneously, or are the water slides just an image booster? Why would anyone ever want a mushroom-flavored sports drink? But the most important question is this: Why, oh why, is he hiding?

Here are three reported reasons the North Korean dictator is lying low.

Possible Reason No. 1: Cheese, Apparently

It’s true. Several news sources, including The Daily Mirror, are suggesting that most sinister culprit: Emmental. Apparently, Kim really, really loves the Swiss cheese (who doesn’t?), and has huge amounts imported for his own personal consumption (I would too, if I could). But it’s possible he’s been enjoying the delicious snack just a little too enthusiastically — he’s gained a lot of weight really quickly, and the media noticed that the last time he was in public, he was walking with a limp.

In other words, the North Korean leader may be out of action because he’s made himself ill by eating too much cheese. Strangely, this is the most endearing I’ve ever found the dictator.

Possible Reason No. 2: Gout

Another explanation for the weight gain and limp: gout. In fact a type of arthritis, gout causes intense pain and sometimes weight gain (so maybe, it’s not all the Emmental’s fault after all). Michael Madden, a journalist for the 38 North website, said that “based on his gait, it appears he has gout — something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family.”

Possible Reason No. 3: Security

Of course, North Korea always has internal political and military struggles going on, and this isn’t even first time that Kim has lain low — back in 2012, he went missing from the media spotlight for two weeks without any explanation. So some are interpreting his disappearance as nothing more than a precautionary security measure. As Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, told the Daily Telegraph:

Another reason why Kim may be reluctant to appear in public is the ongoing power struggle inside the North Korean military, which means that the situation in Pyongyang is still unstable.

It’s possible. On Friday, state media confirmed for the first time that Kim’s health isn’t too good, acknowledging that he’s been dealing with some “discomfort.” Hmm, seems like a cheese-related problem to me.

1218,"""How nice pants"" (referring to the rear) is probably the last sentence expect to hear a mother her son, still less that the tell her. Since last November 23 flows through social networks a video of Peru where a clash between two street bullies with their mothers is simulated and already numbers more than three million views on Youtube.



Under the slogan Sílbale your mother , the sports brand Everlast and the organization Stop Street Harassment -the first Latin American Observatory against acoso- recorded a mockumentary in which pretended to have identified bullies then contact their mothers, you change their look and make it happen where their children were.

This performance by actors is based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed by mistake to a female relative and expressed ""deep shame"". Another inspiration for starting the campaign was the famous case of harassment suffered by the Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, star of The Empty Nest, while traveling on public transport. ""I'm cholera in Peru not put a stop to sexual harassment in the public media. The rapist has more rights than the victims,"" ​​said the actress after the incident last May.


Natalia Málaga, coach of the national women's volleyball team, is responsible for instructing mothers in this video with appearance of hidden camera that was released two days before the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and has viralizado especially through Facebook pages as that of Hora Cero Web , a Mexican digital newspaper where he has two million views.

In YouTube video has reached Friday three million copies and has been featured in several publications in media throughout Latin America. In the official pages of Everlast has been shared more than 100,000 times, making it the most successful viral country, according to information provided by Maria Paz Delgado, head of marketing for Everlast Peru.

1220,"International Business Machines Corp. is reportedly on the cusp of laying off about 26% of its 430,000-strong workforce, or 111,800 people, as part of its biggest-ever corporate restructuring.

The unconfirmed report from Forbes suggests that U.S. employees will be “hit hard” in the overhaul, code-named Project Chrome, but that the layoffs will stretch to many of the company’s “worldwide service operations.”

In his report, long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely writes that the massive cuts will start this week and be completed by the end of February.

The layoffs would be the largest in the company’s history, topping 60,000 jobs it cut in 1993.

IBM shares rose 2%, or US$3.13, to US$159.00 in early morning trading in New York.

Cringely’s report suggests that Project Chrome has been in the works since before Christmas and is likely being rolled out now in response to IBM’s announcement last week of its 11th straight quarter of falling revenue.

Revenue fell 12% in the fourth quarter, shrinking across every reported unit and every geography.

The technology and consulting company has struggled as business customers have moved away from buying big mainframe computers and traditional software that’s installed on their own systems.

IBM has been spending heavily to develop new products, such as data analytics and artificial intelligence programs and “cloud” software that IBM delivers to customers over the Internet. But those new businesses have not grown as fast as the company hoped, while revenue has continued to fall in IBM’s traditional software, hardware and technology services businesses.

Cringely paints the coming cuts as a “pure accounting resource action” engineered by executives and “designed to make IBM’s financials look better for the next few quarters.”

1228,"Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. claimed Wednesday that ISIS has been forcing doctors to harvest organs from the bodies of the people it's killed, and then selling those organs to fund its operations, according to an AP report. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim called for a Security Council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys.

According to Alkalim, a dozen doctors have been killed in Mosul because they wouldn't take part in the Islamic State's organ trafficking scheme.

Unconfirmed rumors of ISIS removing and selling organs have been around since at least December, when Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor published an article with more detailed claims than Alkalim made this week.

Based on a report from one doctor in Mosul, Al-Monitor wrote:

Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs ... the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said.
The Al-Monitor story also claims that the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed ""the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest,"" a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in December, but seems to be based entirely on this single source. (As far as I can tell, there's no mention of the trafficking operation in OHCHR's published reports on Iraq, and Alkalim didn't mention OHCHR in his statement to the Security Council.)

The Islamic State is incredibly money-hungry, Newsweek reported in a detailed look at the revenue streams ISIS uses to support the 8 million people in its territories, including more than 10,000 active fighters. There's no mention of selling kidneys, but ISIS needs all the money it can get, and if they're willing to conduct small-time local kidnappings for as little as $500, moving organs isn't so farfetched.

1229,"Apple is forecast to have shipped a whopping 73 million iPhones over the 2014 holiday quarter on strong iPhone 6 demand, according to one well-connected analyst who also expects a busy start to 2015 for the company, with Apple Watch sales in March and a rumored 12-inch MacBook Air coming sometime before April.

In a research note from well-connected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by AppleInsider, Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models led a charge to 73 million overall unit sales for the quarter ending December. The analyst estimates the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 to hit more than 42 million, while the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 ""phablet"" contributed with just over 16 million unit sales.

If the numbers hold up, Apple is in for a record-smashing holiday quarter. Kuo's estimates are well above expectations from other leading investment banks including UBS, which earlier this month forecast Apple to sell 69 million iPhones.

Momentum from Apple's iPhone 6 lineup will spill into the first quarter, driving overall iPhone shipments to an about 61.7 million unit sales. A performance of that caliber would buffer seasonally slow sales.

Consistent with the latest reports, Kuo also expects the highly anticipated Apple Watch to launch in March. While Apple has stayed mum on exact specifications, the company could fill in the blanks with a special announcement prior to the device's debut, the analyst said.

Assuming a March launch, Apple Watch is expected to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter, meaning those sales will be spread across a relatively short one-month span. Kuo says most component suppliers will see shipments in the 4 million to 5 million unit range through the March quarter, but a few manufacturers are seeing low yields on key parts, slowing down final assembly and shipping.

On Apple's rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display, Kuo is forecasting a ship-by date sometime this quarter. The all-new thin-and-light, said to sport a Retina display, ultra-thin form factor and Intel's latest mobile chips, will help fuel a 2.6-percent quarter-over-quarter increase in Mac shipments. Kuo expects Mac sales to hit 6 million units for the first three months of 2015, up slightly from 5.9 million forecast for Q4 2014.

Aside from industry scuttlebutt, not much is known about Apple's ultraportable newcomer. A set of photos posted online yesterday purportedly show the laptop's display assembly, which boasts edge-to-edge glass with black bezels and eschews the usual translucent Apple logo for a polished insert more in line with the latest iOS devices.

Finally, Kuo sees drooping sell through for iPad as Apple's recently released iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 models largely failed to move the needle during the holiday season. For the December quarter, estimates put iPad shipments down 17.8 percent year-over-year to 21.4 million units. Moving into the first quarter of 2015, iPad could hit 10.1 million unit sales, but the number is still weak, down 38 percent compared to the same time last year.

Interestingly, Kuo models a rise in shipments for older iPad versions during the March quarter while at the same time revising down previous estimates of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.

1230,"People wanting to buy an Apple Watch may be able to ask for a custom engraving, much as the company has allowed with products like the iPad and iPod before it, although the option may not be available in time for the product's launch.

Then information comes French website iPhonote, citing a source claimed to be tied to Apple. The person allegedly said they are virtually certain engraving will become available, whether sooner or later.

If the company follows its past pattern of past engraving options, such as with the iPad and iPod, only online orders will qualify.

One question is where an engraving would fit on the diminutive, wearable Apple Watch. There is very little space around the bezels of the Watch, and the underside is dominated by a heartrate sensor, as well as some of Apple's own markings such as the serial number.

iPhonote is relatively unknown site with no established track record. Apple does however have a history of offering engravings for iPhones, iPods, and iPads.

Conventional watches are frequently engraved, moreover, and the option would make sense given Apple's emphasis on personalization in official marketing. The company has taken the Watch to a number of fashion magazines, and highlighted different combinations of body materials and wrist straps.

More details about the product are due to be announced at a Monday press event, whee AppleInsider will be in attendance with live coverage.

That puts it in the same category as traditional luxury watches and to reflect its status, renowned Apple reporter Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac has revealed that Apple has begun installing specially designed safes at its retail stores to keep the expensive items locked-down when the stores are closed. The safes will feature integrated Apple Watch MagSafe chargers to make sure the demo units will be powered up and ready to go each morning. April launch Apple is preparing to launch its first wearable, with CEO Tim Cook last week confirming that the company was due to begin selling the devices from April, having revealed the highly anticipated wearable in October 2014. Staff at Apple's retail stores are due to begin training on how to sell and demo the Watch this month, while the company's stores will be reconfigured in the coming months in order to properly showcase the new devices. The Apple Watch will come in three flavours (Watch, Watch Sport, and Watch Edition) with each available in two sizes (38mm and 42mm) and a variety of straps including stainless steel, leather and ""durable high-performance fluoroelastomer"" - or plastic to you and me. Apple has announced that the price of the Apple Watch Sport will be $349 in the US, with the company yet to announce a UK-specific price or pricing for any other model. The Apple Watch is an intriguing product and one which - like the iPad and iPhone - could kickstart a revolution in the smartwatch category.

Alex's parents fear they may be dragged into a court battle - all because their son chose a day out with his grandparents over a pal's birthday party

Just before the Christmas holidays, Alex, their son, was invited to a classmate’s Birthday party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre.

Alex, who goes to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School, told his parents he wanted to go and so Mr Nash and his partner confirmed he would be at the celebration.

Mr Nash said: “She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

But Mr Nash later realised he had arranged for Alex and his sister Lily to out for a day trip with their grandparents.

“By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know,” explained Mr Nash.

“So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do; he chose to be with his grandparents.”

On January 6 Alex went back to school as the new term got under way.

Mr Nash continued: “My partner looked out for [the friend’s mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn’t see her.

“But on January 15 she looked in Alex’s school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child’s party no show fee.

The bill Alex brought home. He was not charged VAT on his birthday party no-show...

“I asked Alex’s class teacher if [the child’s mother] had given anything to her. She said, ‘Yes, a brown envelope’.

“I then visited Alex’s school headteacher, who couldn’t apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

“She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.”

“I left the school and went to see [the birthday boy’s mother] as her address was on the invoice.

“When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my son’s school bag and that I wasn’t happy about it.

“I told her I would not be paying her the money.

“I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son’s school bag.”

He added: “I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can’t believe the way she has gone around it.”

The couple claim that the mother of Alex’s friend has threatened the couple with taking the case to the small claims court.

And five-year-old Alex has told his parents that his classmate will no longer play with him after he didn’t show up to the party.


Poor Alex says his friend will no longer play with him at school since the row broke out

Mr Nash said: “I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

“They’re all quite incredulous that this has happened.

“I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.”

Mr Nash’s partner has been in contact with the mum via Facebook hoping to resolve the situation.

The mother of Alex’s friend was unavailable for comment when contacted by The Herald.


Full Facebook conversation between Alex's mum Tanya and the birthday boy's mum Julie.

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie. This is Alex's mum. I don't know what has happened between you and my partner, Derek. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex's school bag. I did not realise that you had to pay for each child, as you never mentioned anything about money when we spoke. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I did not know this. On the day Alex decided that he wanted to spend time with his nan and grandad. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an e-mail for you to let you know the situation(I also didn't know your first name, or I would have looked you up). If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably.

Julie Lawrence

Hi Tanya, I didn't mention the money when we spoke because it was a child's party, it doesn't matter if you have to pay per person or for a group if people agree to going, I confirmed that with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don't like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won't get any money out of me, rather rudely, I do admit it rattled me. This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable ? Julie

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie, who's party is Alex supposed to have gone to? I did speak to another mum about a party but she never got back to me with details, other than that I don't recall any other confirmed invites. The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex's school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. He spoke to the headteacher about and she said that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing. Birthday invites are fine, but not personal items. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don't know what it's actually paying for. Alex was very excited to go to the party. I didn't know until the day about his nan and grandad, and he decided he would rather spend the day with them. Like I said before I didn't have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.

Julie Lawrence

You are paying for 1 x child's party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch, to with you said Alex was attending on the Thursday

Tanya Walsh

Just so you know, small claims court cost #60 just to start a claim. Also I'm not paying for something we didn't use.

Julie Lawrence

It doesn't cost that much

Tanya Walsh

It does. Also I don't think the school are very happy with you involving them in this either. I don't know why you are out for our blood and slandering us. I've told you the reasons why alex didn't go. I also told you why I couldn't call. You also don't seem to understand that I never ran away from you. I didnt hear you calling after me. I have to get to my daughter at carbeile. So if they let alex out last then I have to rush a bit because evie, my 2 year old, walks slow. So maybe that's why you thought I was rushing off. I had no reason to run to run away from you. So please do not state things as truth when you do not have all the facts. Maybe if you actually spoke to me rather than making your own mind up about what happened then none of this would be happening right now. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice.",five year old alex nash dad derek holding invoice professional looking invoice even contains space vat alex say friend longer play school since row broke dad derek nash

1243,"According to a Saturday Benzinga report that references “a source familiar with the matter”, it has been revealed that Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (OTCBB:LNVGY) could make an offer to acquire Canadian telecommunication and wireless equipment company BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) as early as this week. The source told the publication that Lenovo’s first offer for the struggling smartphone maker would be “$15.00 per share, with a deal ultimately getting done around $18.00 per share.”


This isn’t the first time the $15 billion market cap company has been linked with BlackBerry. In January 2013, Lenovo’s chief financial officer Wong Wai Ming told Bloomberg “We are looking at all opportunities – RIM [still known as Research in Motion at that time] and many others. We’ll have no hesitation if the right opportunity comes along.”

BlackBerry played down the comment. Later that month Canadian Industry Minister Christian Paradis said that he would prefer the smarthone maker to grow “organically.” The Canadian government reportedly stopped Lenovo’s takeover of BlackBerry due to national security concerns.

BlackBerry declined to comment to Benzinga on a possible Lenovo bid.

“The company does not comment on rumors or speculation,” said a spokesman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company.

1244,"The Tampa, Fla. woman who claimed to have had plastic surgery to add a third breast is fake, according to TMZ.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, was reportedly discovered to have faked the plastic surgery after TMZ obtained a police report filed by Tridevil after her bag was stolen at Tampa International Airport.

TMZ reports that the bag was stolen off of an American Airlines conveyor belt and a ""3 breast prosthesis"" was found inside by police after they recovered the bag.

Buzzfeed initially reported the woman's strange look landed her appearances on ""Inside Edition"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" but FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.",tampa fla woman claimed plastic surgery add third breast fake according tmz woman go name jasmine tridevil reportedly discovered faked plastic surgery tmz obtained police report filed tridevil bag stolen tampa international airport tmz report bag stolen american airline conveyor belt breast prosthesis found inside police recovered bag buzzfeed initially reported woman strange look landed appearance inside edition jimmy kimmel live fox talked inside edition told u interviewing schedule get sent kimmel guest either fox talked inside edition told u interviewing schedule get sent kimmel guest either trying track story find tridevil real name cell phone number gave call far received reply voice mail message shame several question ask unique tale tridevil said recent radio interview got surgery month ago hard time finding doctor would agree request issue really hard finding somebody would breaking code ethic said called doctor one would say eventually found doctor agreed surgery sign confidentiality agreement stating reveal identity said paid purported surgery tridevil also say currently filming reality show hope land mtv,fox talked inside edition told u interviewing schedule get sent kimmel guest either fox talked inside edition told u interviewing schedule get sent kimmel guest either trying track story find tridevil real name cell phone number gave call far received reply voice mail message shame several question ask unique tale tridevil said recent radio interview got surgery month ago hard time finding doctor would agree request issue really hard finding somebody would break code ethic said called doctor one would say eventually found doctor agreed surgery sign confidentiality agreement stating reveal identity said paid purported surgery
1246,"And now for a story that will warm you all the way down to your soul. And it's cold outside (even in Los Angeles!), so think of this as an Internet blanket for your entire being.
Mr. R., a primary school teacher, recently came out to his class during a lesson in using the word ""gay"" as an insult.
""As part of anti-bullying week, I'd asked who'd heard ‘gay' being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned,"" he told Pink News. ""After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I'm gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they're talking about me.""

He said the reaction was very ""fantastic,"" and after a couple of minutes of answering questions from the class (like if he had a boyfriend), they moved on from the lesson.
A couple of days later, he received this note from one of his nine-year-old students. Adorable errors have been kept in because it somehow makes the letter cuter:
Letter to Gay Teacher

Dear Mr R—:
Even though you're gay, I will alway's treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You're a great teacher and these are just some of the word's that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.
The reason why I say brave, is because you shared a personal secret, which was very brave.
You don't have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.
From A—

P.S. Mr R—, we are all proud of you.

Don't you feel warm all over? Just reading about how a nine-year-old girl could so lovingly accept her teacher like that when many, many others could not do the same is better than drinking a giant mug of hot chocolate with marshmallows.
""Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself,"" Mr. R said. ""For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgment, no follow up, just acceptance. Now, I can mention my fiancé as easily as any other teacher and my class knows me a little better. I've had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I'll keep forever.""

1248,"Looks like he used up all his nine lives!

A cat in Florida that was hit by a car and then buried is apparently back from the dead.

""I was so shocked,"" owner Ellis Hutson told ABC News. ""I didn’t know really what to do.""

And today, Bart the cat is having surgery at the Humane Society to repair his jaw and remove his eye.

Meet the Guy Delivering Food to Snowed-In New Yorkers
Unleashed 'Polar Bear' Delights Residents
""We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake,"" the Humane Society of Tampa said on its website.

The cat's owner, Hutson, 52, said he found Bart the cat two weeks ago in the middle of the road, lifeless in a puddle of blood.

Hutson said he asked his friend to help bury the 23-month old cat, because the landscaper was so distraught after losing a companion he's had since he was a kitten.

""We were so close, I couldn’t stand to bury him,"" Hutson said. ""I put him on the shoulder of the road and went and got David. He dug a hole and covered up the cat with dirt. I witnessed him bury the cat.""

Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor's yard alive, but weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention.

""I open the door and my neighbor's standing there with the cat in her hand,"" Hutson said. ""She said, 'Bart is not dead.' I said, 'That’s impossible. We buried Bart.'""

Bart has been treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye. The Humane Society veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to return home after recovering a couple days.

""This is unbelievable. I don’t have any explanation for it,"" Hutson said.

Hutson said he will pay for the surgery costs for the cat. The total cost for the care of Bart, including today’s surgery and post-operative care, will be around $2,000, the Humane Society said.

Hutson's neighbor Dusty Albritton started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the cat’s medical expenses.

“I saw him with my own eyes. I know he was dead. He was cold and stiff,” Albritton told ABC News.

Albritton’s cat died the same day with similar injuries.

“We figured he was hit by the same car,” she said.

“Now my kids believe their cat will also rise from the dead,"" she said with a chuckle. ""But I told them I don't think so.""

When she discovered the resurrected Bart, she said he acted “like he’s in no pain whatsoever.”

“The only thing I can think of is that this is God’s miracle. And I thought, why five days later? If Bart was alive before, he would have come to our homes earlier. All I can think of is that God created animal life on the fifth day.“

Bart was a kitten from Hutson's girlfriend's cat. He said this has been an emotional ordeal for him and his girlfriend, but he hasn't tried explaining the situation to his two-year old daughter.

""As a two-year old, she doesn't understand any of this either,"" he said.",look like used nine life cat florida hit car buried apparently back dead shocked owner elli hutson told abc news know really today bart cat surgery humane society repair jaw remove eye meet guy delivering food snowed new yorkers unleashed polar bear delight resident seen many amazing case full service veterinary clinic situation may take cake humane society tampa said website cat owner hutson said found bart cat two week ago middle road lifeless puddle blood hutson said asked friend help bury month old cat landscaper distraught losing companion since kitten close stand bury hutson said put shoulder road went got david dug hole covered cat dirt witnessed bury cat five day later cat showed neighbor yard alive weak dehydrated need medical attention open door neighbor standing cat hand hutson said said bart dead said impossible buried bart bart treated broken jaw open facial wound ruined eye humane society veterinarian expect recover able return home recovering couple day unbelievable explanation hutson said hutson said pay surgery cost cat total cost care bart including today surgery post operative care around humane society said hutson neighbor dusty albritton started gofundme page raise money cat medical expense saw eye know dead cold stiff albritton told abc news albritton cat died day similar injury figured hit car said kid believe cat also rise dead said chuckle told think discovered resurrected bart said acted like pain whatsoever thing think god miracle thought five day later bart alive would come home earlier think god created animal life fifth day bart kitten hutson girlfriend cat said emotional ordeal girlfriend tried explaining situation two year old daughter two year old understand either said,florida hit car buried apparently back dead shocked owner elli hutson told abc news know really today bart cat surgery humane society repair jaw remove eye meet guy delivering food snowed new yorkers unleashed polar bear delight resident seen many amazing case full service veterinary clinic situation may take cake humane society tampa said website cat owner hutson said found bart cat two week ago middle road lifeless puddle blood hutson said asked friend help bury month old cat landscaper distr
1250,"BEIRUT (AP) - An Internet video purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State group.

Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.

In the video distributed Tuesday and entitled ""A Second Message to America,"" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.

A Florida native, Sotloff grew up in Miami. He graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he received a journalism award, according to Manchester TV station WMUR. He went on to attend the University of Central Florida.

1257,"A woman in China is facing jail time for slicing off her 3-year-old nephew’s penis in anger.

Xue Paan was babysitting her nephew, 3-year-old Qiang Qiang, while Qiang’s mother – Paan’s sister – went to visit neighbors nearby.

Reports indicate that Paan was sitting on the toilet texting her boyfriend when the toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.

The toddler’s question reportedly sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife, and completely severed the screaming child’s penis.

The 37-year-old woman then allegedly fled the scene. Qiang’s mother heard his screams and rushed back the apartment.

“I had popped out to see a neighbor and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream,” Qiang’s mother said.

Inquisitr reports that the child had apparently fainted and was lying in a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived; a knife was next to his severed penis.

Qiang’s mother recalls that she “couldn’t believe what I saw.”

The young boy was rushed to the hospital, where surgeons managed to reattach his penis. He was then sent to a specialist in Beijing.

A hospital spokesperson told reporters that, although the boy’s penis was reattached, “it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment. However, he has now had three surgeries, all of which have been successful, and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

Paan was arrested. She admitted to attacking the boy because she was angry that “he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

1259,"Dead or alive? Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Photo: AP

Beirut: The fate of the self-proclaimed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains unclear, with rumours that he was wounded in a US air strike in Iraq still unconfirmed.

The United States Central Command said coalition aircraft did conduct a series of airstrikes on a convoy in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul where it is thought there was a gathering of Islamic State leaders.

It is believed there were at least 50 casualties from the attack.

However Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman at Central Command, said: ""We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,"" the Guardian reported.

One of Baghdadi's key aides, Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, is known to have died in the attack and as he was known to travel with the leadership it has prompted a raft of speculation as to the well-being of Baghdadi.

A Twitter account purported to be run by an IS spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, appeared to confirm the self-declared caliph had been injured.

""Perhaps you suspected that the caliphate ended with martyrdom of the caliph. I assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank God, and I wish him a speedy recovery.""

However commentators have cast doubt on those comments, with some labelling the Twitter account a fake.

Two people who say they witnessed an airstrike on a house near the western Iraqi border town of al-Qaim where senior Islamic State officials were meeting told Reuters the militants had evacuated a local hospital so their wounded could be treated.

Meanwhile, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official told Associated Press on Sunday that the strike on al-Qaim in Anbar province had wounded Baghdadi, while a senior Iraqi military official also said he had heard Baghdadi had been wounded in the attack.

Baghdadi's last public appearance was in a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July, in which he declared himself the leader of a new caliphate that stretched from Syria into Iraq.

One commentator and author, Juan Cole, cautioned against placing too much hope that – should the death of Baghdadi be confirmed – the Islamic State would be weakened.

""The US has killed a long line of al-Qaeda leaders by now, from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006 to Bin Laden himself,"" Mr Cole wrote on his Informed Comment blog on Sunday.

""The military's theory that leadership is rare and attrition wrought on leaders is decisive in defeating a group is simply incorrect. ISIL's toolbox of terrorising and coercing people is available to large numbers of people.""

Britain's chief of defence staff, General Sir Nick Houghton, also warned that Islamic State would regroup if its leader had been killed.

Speaking to the BBC, General Houghton said: ""What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse within [IS].

""They will regenerate leadership … because of the current potential attractiveness of this warped ideology. Unless we get the political dimension of the strategy in place, then [IS] has the potential to keep regenerating and certainly regenerating its leaders.""",dead alive islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi photo ap beirut fate self proclaimed islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi remains unclear rumour wounded u air strike iraq still unconfirmed united state central command said coalition aircraft conduct series airstrikes convoy northern iraqi city mosul thought gathering islamic state leader believed least casualty attack however colonel patrick ryder spokesman central command said confirm isil leader abu bakr al baghdadi among present guardian reported one baghdadi key aide abdul rahman al athaee known died attack known travel leadership prompted raft speculation well baghdadi twitter account purported run spokesman abu mohammed al adnani appeared confirm self declared caliph injured perhaps suspected caliphate ended martyrdom caliph assure islamic nation emir abu bakr al baghdadi well thank god wish speedy recovery however commentator cast doubt comment labelling twitter account fake two people say witnessed airstrike house near western iraqi border town al qaim senior islamic state official meeting told reuters militant evacuated local hospital wounded could treated meanwhile iraqi interior ministry official told associated press sunday strike al qaim anbar province wounded baghdadi senior iraqi military official also said heard baghdadi wounded attack baghdadi last public appearance mosque northern iraqi city mosul july declared leader new caliphate stretched syria iraq one commentator author juan cole cautioned placing much hope death baghdadi confirmed islamic state would weakened u killed long line al qaeda leader abu musab al zarqawi bin laden mr cole wrote informed comment blog sunday military theory leadership rare attrition wrought leader decisive defeating group simply incorrect isil toolbox terrorising coercing people available large number people britain chief defence staff general sir nick houghton also warned islamic state would regroup leader killed speaking bbc general houghton said want rush sense potential death one totemic leader going create strategic reverse within regenerate leadership current potential attractiveness warped ideology unless get political dimension strategy place potential keep regenerating certainly regenerating leader,isil leader abu bakr al baghdadi among present guardian reported one baghdadi key aide abdul rahman al athaee known died attack known travel leadership prompted raft speculation well baghdadi twitter account purported run spokesman abu mohammed al adnani appeared confirm self declared caliph injured perhaps suspected caliphate ended martyrdom caliph assure islamic nation emir abu bakr al baghdadi well
1264,"Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.
The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.
The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.
Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received the Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.
The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”
She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

The Human Society of Tampa Bay released a statement to ABC, explaining what happened to Bart after his owner discovered that he had been hit by a car:

""The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive!""

How does the Humane Society believe the cat pulled off the feat? It wasn't easy, even for this resilient little guy.

""He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit in weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention,"" the society explained.

He had wounds on his face, a broken jaw and a ruined eye. The owner couldn't afford vet treatments, so the cat was taken to the Humane Society, which is now taking care of him.

Unfortunately Bart still has a long road ahead of him. He is unable to eat because he is in so much pain. Tuesday he will undergo surgery, when the society will wire his jaw, repair his palette, insert a temporary feeding tube and remove his damaged eye.

There is good news, though, for Bart the miracle cat: The society believes he will be at home recovering soon.

1275,"DEPRAVED Islamic State militants are attempting to SELL the remains of at least one of Western hostage beheaded in Syria, it has emerged.

Middlemen with alleged ties to the terror group have revealed that extremists are trying to raise war funds by selling the mutilated bodies of its dead captives, including American freelance journalist James Foley.

The 40-year-old was brutally murdered by a militant dubbed 'Jihadi John' on August 19, in the first high-profile execution of a Western hostage by the group.

In the months since his death, IS have continued to release footage of more beheadings including US journalist Steven Sotloff and British humanitarian aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.

Sources close to the radical Sunni Islamist terror group told Buzzfeed that IS want $1 million (£636,000) for Mr Foley’s body, which it has promised to deliver across the border to Turkey.

IS negotiators said the group would be willing to provide a DNA sample in order to prove identification of the body.

A former Syrian rebel fighter, speaking anonymously, has admitted he was approached by IS leaders to sell the US citizen's mutilated remains to his country's government or family.

He said: ""They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first. They will not give the DNA without the money.""

The anonymous fighter claimed his motivation for getting involved with the exchange was justified – because he only wanted to help Mr Foley's grieving family find closure.

He called his work ""a humanity case.""

The source said that all final negotiations around the sale of the beheaded journalist would be conducted through a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA).

The US-backed rebel coalition has previously been involved in talks over the release of US and European hostages.

It is understood that the US government is seeking to put a stop to the sale.

Having allowed hostages to die in IS custody, the FSA official reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded.

In the past, James Foley’s parents revealed that the US government had threatened them with prosecution if they tried to pay a ransom for their son’s release.

The FSA source added: ""It will be like a shame for the US government. People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.""

The FSA official described himself as the ""manager"" of proposed negotiations and revealed he had previously been approached to negotiate Mr Foley's release while the US citizen was still alive.

The Foley family have refused to comment on the allegations surrounding the sale of the journalist's body.

However, a US State Department spokesperson said they were actively ""seeking more information"" on the sale of the remains.

1276,"A women has been arrested in China after reports that she chopped off her husband's penis twice after catching him cheating.

Feng Lung, 30, flew into a rage after finding her husband's messages to his lover in their home in the city of Shangqiu in eastern Henan province.

Fan Lung, 32, used Feng's phone to send the saucy messages to Zhang Hung, 21, but forgot to log out of his email account.

Feng proceeded to get a pair of scissors and attack Fan while he was sleeping, chopping off his manhood.

He was rushed to hospital where his penis was reattached. But it did not end there.

After the emergency operation, Feng went back to Fan's hospital room and severed his penis for a second time before throwing it out of the window where it was feared to have been taken by an animal, according to doctors.

""The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,"" a hospital spokesman said, according to The Mirror.

""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

""He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.""

Fan's lover said that she would stick by him despite his lack of manhood, saying: ""It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already.""

Feng has been arrested for grevious bodily harm by Chinese authorities in relation to the incident.

1279,"NEW YORK—Oil prices jumped Wednesday on unconfirmed rumors in the market that a pipeline exploded in Saudi Arabia, raising fears that the country’s crude production and exports could be curtailed.

A spokesperson for Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s oil company, told The Wall Street Journal that the company has seen the rumors, which circulated on Twitter, but isn’t able to confirm them.

Prices have been sliding for months on concerns that the market is oversupplied and that Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, is unlikely to cut production to raise prices.

Light, sweet oil for December delivery recently traded up $1.84, or 2.4%, to $79.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent, the global benchmark, rose $1.52, or 1.8%, to $84.34 on ICE Futures Europe. Earlier in the session, prices were trading lower around $82.50 a barrel.

Weekly inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which showed a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. crude supplies, also supported prices.

December gasoline futures recently rose 2.1% to $2.1211 a gallon. December diesel rose 1.5% to $2.4793 a gallon.

If there are any questions about cats having nine lives, look no further than the story one man is telling the Humane Society of Tampa Bay.

He says his beloved cat, Bart, was hit by a vehicle and left for dead in the road.

Ellis Hutson said he even knows the exact spot where he buried the cat.

But somehow, he says, Bart dug its way out of the ground and wound up in his neighbor's front yard days later – alive.

The man told rescuers he was sure it was dead. He has no explanation for what happened. When they found Bart alive, they rushed it to the hospital.

Bart is at the Human Society of Tampa Bay right now, and rescuers told FOX 13 that he has severe trauma to the head, a broken jaw, a dead eye, and other injuries. Right now, doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life.

FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and hid for a few days.

They say he's likely to live, but he will lose his eye.

1284,"The Apple Watch will reportedly be available in other countries, including Germany, when it launches in April, according to 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman.

Apple CEO Tim Cook shared this information with employees at the company's flagship store in Berlin, according to Gurman, who says he spoke with an Apple employee in attendance.

Specifically, Cook said the watch won't be exclusive to the United States in April.

It's unclear which markets the Apple Watch will be available in, and whether or not it will be released at exactly the same time in multiple markets. As Gurman points out, it's possible Apple could release the Apple Watch in the US before releasing it to international markets such as Germany later in the month.

This is a somewhat unusual move for Apple to make with a first-generation product. Both the iPhone and iPad were available exclusively in the US before expanding to other markets.

Apple has been showing off its watch at boutiques in Paris and in the Paris edition of Vogue, so it seems like the company is making a push to market the watch overseas as well, as Gurman also noted.

We expect to learn more next week when Apple holds its press event on March 9.

1285,"A 19-year-old from Brighton is reportedly among five British jihadis killed in the American airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria.

The mother of Ibrahim Kamara learned of her son's death through social media after the US strikes on the country - primarily aimed at Islamic Sate - on Tuesday, The Guardian reported.

An image was posted to Facebook - which has not been verified - that apparently shows Kamara in an unzipped body bag.

News of Ibrahim Kamara's death reached his mother by social media

If it is confirmed, he is among the first Britons killed in Syria by US action.

Kamara, who was known as Khalil al-Britani, is thought to have been fighting for al Nusra, an affiliate group of al Qaeda, is believed to have been one of five men killed in a drone strike on Aleppo.

His mother Khadijah Kamara, 35, told The Guardian her son rang her in February to say he was in Syria and she hung up.

When he rang again, she told him: ""Don't ever call me again.""

After his death, she said: ""I cried when I could not do anything about it.

""I cried then. What's left to cry now? I have three other boys, I have to be strong for them.""

She told ITV News: ""I knew something like this (would happen), if someone's in a warzone area.""

When asked about how she felt about her son being in Syria, she said: ""I've always been angry inside. I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe a member of my family could even think about this kind of thing.""

She said she was angry at people who ""brainwashed"" her son and the airport for allowing him to travel to the warzone on his 15-year-old brother's passport.

""Who would let someone travel on a 15-year-old's passport? It was not his passport yet he got away with it. I will never figure this out.""

1286,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?",massage therapist claim undergone plastic surgery obtain third breast jasmine tridevil real name say surgery month ago hell bent starring reality tv show year old hired camera crew follow around hope pitch show mtv writing facebook page say upcoming appearance jimmy kimmel show inside edition jasmine tridevil say contact doctor found one willing perform surgery controversial surgery told real radio contact doctor found surgeon agreed carry procedure really hard finding someone would breaking code ethic one agreed carry operation claimed made sign non disclosure agreement scared get trouble tridevil dream starring reality tv show tampa resident tridevil recently celebrated st birthday say parent taken news transformation well said mum ran door talk let sister talk dad really happy kind ashamed accepted tridevil say surgery cost included nipple implant claim areole tattooed around nipple surgery look familiar three breasted woman first made appearance total recall also revealed got wanted make unattractive men want date anymore guy would think extra breast weird gross still feel pretty wore makeup cute clothes still know feel pretty um right tridevil bold new look course reminiscent infamous scene arnold schwarzenegger film total recall kaitlyn leeb reprised role remake film upon meeting prostitute three breast one enamoured suitor exclaims baby make wish three hand film remade yes three breasted woman made another appearance toronto based model actress kaitlyn leeb took role even decided display prosthetic triple cleavage comic con event think agree leeb prosthetics pretty convincing could tridevil simply followed suit knife,nipple implant claim areole tattooed around nipple surgery look familiar three breasted woman first made appearance total recall also revealed got wanted make unattractive men want date anymore guy would think extra breast weird gross still feel pretty um right tridevil bold new look course reminiscent of scene arnold schwarzenegger film total recall kaitlyn leeb reprise role remake film upon meeting prostitute three breast one enamoured suitor exclaims baby make wish
1287,"Notorious murderer Charles Manson, 80, is probably relieved that his jailhouse marriage license expired last week. According to the author of an upcoming book, the inmate’s fiancé, Afton Elaine “Star” Burton, 26, only wanted to marry him so that she could display his dead corpse as a tourist attraction after his death.

Journalist Daniel Simone, author of the upcoming The Retrial of Charles Manson, told the New York Post that Burton wanted access to Manson’s corpse so that she could display it in public in a glass enclosure after his death, in a kind of “bizarre California version of Lenin’s tomb.”

“He finally realized that he’s been played for a fool,” Simone told the Post of Manson, who was set to marry Burton after the pair secured a marriage license last year. The wedding had to be scrapped after the 90-day marriage license expired before the couple could tie the knot.

However, Simone tells the paper that Manson had another, perfectly sensible reason for turning Burton down.

“He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

According to the Associated Press, Burton left her home in Illinois and moved to Central California to be near California State Prison, Corcoran, where Manson is incarcerated.

Manson and several of his “family” members were convicted in 1971 for the brutal murders of seven people, including Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, and married couple Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.

Manson was at first sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole when California tossed out the death penalty in 1972.

Manson was denied parole for the twelfth time in April 2012. He will next be eligible in 2027, when he will be 92 years old.",notorious murderer charles manson probably relieved jailhouse marriage license expired last week according author upcoming book inmate fianc afton elaine star burton wanted marry could display dead corpse tourist attraction death journalist daniel simone author upcoming retrial charles manson told new york post burton wanted access manson corpse could display public glass enclosure death kind bizarre california version lenin tomb finally realized played fool simone told post manson set marry burton pair secured marriage license last year wedding scrapped day marriage license expired couple could tie knot however simone tell paper manson another perfectly sensible reason turning burton feel never die simone said therefore feel stupid idea begin according associated press burton left home illinois moved central california near california state prison corcoran manson incarcerated manson several family member convicted brutal murder seven people including sharon tate pregnant wife director roman polanski married couple leno rosemary labianca manson first sentenced death sentence commuted life imprisonment possibility parole california tossed death penalty manson denied parole twelfth time april next eligible year old,illinois moved central california near california state prison corcoran manson incarcerated manson several family member convicted brutal murder seven people including sharon tate pregnant wife director roman polanski married couple leno rosemary labianca manson first sentenced death sentence commuted life imprisonment possibility parole california tossed death penalty manson denied parole twelfth time april next eligible year old .
1290,"Either Lenovo is very serious about stepping up its mobile phone business or it is getting very desperate. Aside from setting up a third mobile business to target China specifically, rumors are resurfacing that Lenovo is eying to buy BlackBerry out of its woes. Or perhaps the two moves are one and the same, which doesn't make sense either. Whatever Lenovo has planned, we might very well know this week as sources close to the matter tip that Lenovo will be making an offer to buy BlackBerry sometime this week.

This isn't exactly the first time that the largest PC maker has set its eyes on BlackBerry. It was exactly a year ago since we last heard about the Chinese firm's interest in the Canadian company. Of course, neither company confirmed nor denied the matter. The Canadian government, however, was allegedly working in the background to have it blocked, due to security concerns of a Chinese company buying out a Canadian one.

Fast-forward to today, Lenovo is said to make a $15 per share offer to BlackBerry, possibly ending up at around $18 per share. If any of this is true, Lenovo would be what others would call it spreading itself thin across continents. It was lately rumored to be planning on starting a new mobile phone venture in China specifically to rival top dog Xiaomi while still maintaining its own Lenovo branded smartphones in that country. In the US, it is still waiting to conclude the acquisition of Motorola Mobility, whose name and sales also extend to other countries. If it does or at least tries to acquire BlackBerry, then it means that the company is willing to have a fourth mobile business under its control.

The other big question is whether BlackBerry is willing to sell. There have been many rumors and offers during the height of the company's financial crisis, none of which have come to pass as BlackBerry has soldiered on to keep its own brand and business under its own direction. If you only look at news coverage, the company doesn't seem to be in as dire straits, which makes the prospect of a buyout even less enticing. Plus, the company has just launched a fresh new attempt at both the smartphone and the enterprise market, and isn't exactly done yet. Whether those are actually enough to keep BlackBerry afloat is too early to tell, which might be another reason it would not be so interested in an acquisition.

An airline spokesman said that the plane returned to the gate and the woman received medical attention before disembarking. She refused an offer of additional medical treatment but did not return to the aeroplane.

Cabin crew killed the arachnid and checked the overhead compartments for any other creatures.

The flight took off about an hour late, at 8.40pm local time.

A reporter for the Oregonian newspaper, Tyson Alger, who was on the flight, tweeted that a man flicked the scorpion off his shoulder, after which the creature landed on the woman’s hand.

“Chivalry is dead, he added.

Of the 1,500 species of scorpion, only about 30 can inflict lethal stings. Generally, stings are painful but not deadly for healthy adults.

It is not known how the scorpion got on to the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are prevalent.

It is not known which species stung the woman on the Alaska Airlines flight.

1300,"A 9-year-old Texas boy was suspended from school after threatening to use his “Hobbit” ring to make another student disappear, his father says.

Officials at Kermit Elementary School in Winkler County, Texas, said Aiden Steward made a terroristic threat when he told another classmate that he could make him vanish using a ring from the fictional Mount Doom from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth legendarium, the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the New York Daily News.

The principal said threats, real or imagined, to another child’s safety would not be tolerated, Mr. Steward said.

“It sounded unbelievable,” Mr. Steward said, insisting his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”

The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” days earlier.

“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Mr. Steward told the Daily News. “I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence.”

Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the 4th grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, which first reported the story.

Mr. Steward said he requested a written explanation from the school as to how his son’s statements constituted a “terroristic threat” and was told the school would put the letter in the mail.

The Stewards moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, and Aiden has already been suspended from school three times.

Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as “black” and for bringing in his favorite children’s book that included a chapter on pregnancy, the Daily News reported.

“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system, and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Mr. Steward told the paper.",year old texas boy suspended school threatening use hobbit ring make another student disappear father say official kermit elementary school winkler county texas said aiden steward made terroristic threat told another classmate could make vanish using ring fictional mount doom j r r tolkien middle earth legendarium boy father jason steward told new york daily news principal said threat real imagined another child safety would tolerated mr steward said sounded unbelievable mr steward said insisting son mean anything steward watched hobbit battle five army day earlier kid act movie see watched superman kid went outside tried fly mr steward told daily news assure son lack magical power necessary threaten friend existence principal roxanne greer declined comment th grader suspension citing confidentiality policy according odessa american first reported story mr steward said requested written explanation school son statement constituted terroristic threat told school would put letter mail steward moved kermit independent school district six month ago aiden already suspended school three time two disciplinary action year school suspension referring classmate black bringing favorite child book included chapter pregnancy daily news reported love book studying solar system took school thought teacher would impressed mr steward told paper,texas boy suspended school threatening use hobbit ring make another student disappear father say official kermit elementary school winkler county texas said aiden steward made terroristic threat told another classmate could make vanish using ring fictional mount doom j r r tolkien middle earth legendarium boy father jason steward said threat real imagined another child safety would tolerate mr steward said sounded unbelievable mr steward said insisting
1304,"The alleged bra bandit - who supposedly targeted woman's smalls that had been left out to dry - was humiliated after raging residents set a trap

An alleged underwear thief who supposedly targeted woman's lingerie left out to dry has been publicly shamed after being caught red-handed.

Chan Chun Chee, 32, was forced to walk around a block of flats in Singapore with bras and undies hanging from his neck after residents laid a trap following a spate of kinky thefts.

Local man Teo Goh, 56, said: ""We first became suspicious after my wife found one of her bras missing when she woke up in the morning.

""Over the next couple of weeks other residents began noticing lingerie being stolen either from courtyards or balconies and we realised there was a serial thief at work.

""We realised he was targeting windows where he knew women lived.""

Making a point: Residents turned vigilante to trap 'bra-robbing' Chan Chun Chee

Knowing that the perverted prowler would be watching, the residents arranged for a woman to leave some of her freshly-washed underwear by an open window to dry.

Goh explained: ""He came at around midnight and as soon as he was in the room we grabbed him, forced him to wear the girl’s lingeries and then frog-marched him from door to door making him confess what he had done and to promise he would never do it again.

""And then we called the police.""

A police spokesman said: ""We don't condone vigilante activity but in this case it seems to have turned out OK.""

The man now faces three years jail for breaking and entry and theft.

1309,"The United States government said early Wednesday that the video showing the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of an Islamic State militant is authentic.

According to the Twitter page run by President Barack Obama's National Security Council:

The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff & reached judgment it is authentic.

— @NSCPress (@NSCPress) September 3, 2014

The video, which was discovered on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, showed Sotloff being beheaded in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to the slaying, Sotloff was shown kneeling on the ground and wearing orange clothing, a scene that was reminiscent of the Islamic State murder of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

The masked militant on the video warned President Barack Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, ""our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" He also threatened the life of David Haines, a British citizen and aid worker, who was kidnapped in March 2013.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelancer for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, was abducted in 2013 while covering the civil war in Syria.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Sotloff's murder a ""despicable crime,"" the BBC News reported.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement Wednesday, calling the killing of Sotloff ""unfathomable"" and ""an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.""

""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took,"" he said. ""And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.""

1310,"Lisa Bonet did NOT send a “cryptic tweet” about her “Cosby Show” co-star Bill Cosby, despite reports from outlets that don’t bother to fact check.

On Saturday and Sunday, numerous websites such as X17Online claimed Bonet became the “latest person to speak up” about Cosby’s alleged sex crimes when she “posted a telling tweet regarding her possible stance on the matter.” X17 and other disreputable places quoted Bonet as supposedly tweeting, “According to the karma of past actions, one’s destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky… Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!”

Like X17Online, HollywoodLife ran the tweet without checking whether the Twitter account, which wasn’t verified, actually belonged to Bonet. The webloid carelessly wondered if Bonet was “slamming her former onscreen dad” with her “very bold message,” going on to write, “Wow. The tweet certainly fits the disturbing situation, but it could be about something else entirely.” That’s some rock-solid journalism right there.

Let Gossip Cop tell you what others have not: Bonet did NOT send the tweet in question, and that is NOT her Twitter account. In fact, the impostor’s page has already been taken down. A rep for Bonet tells Gossip Cop, “I can assure you that is not her Twitter account and I have had the account suspended. Lisa does not have any social media accounts. She continues to have no comment on the subject.”

As Gossip Cop has reported, the only “Cosby Show” people to comment on the scandal so far have been Raven-Symone and the series’ producers.

1316,"According to TimesLive.com, a 17-year-old woman has allegedly damaged her 25-year-old boyfriend's penis after a sex tape of the two of them was released. The woman, who is unnamed because she is underage, is said to have poured a bottle of acid onto Humphrey Khoza's penis while he was out watching a soccer game with his friends in Mpumalanga, South Africa.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn't realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,"" Khoza reportedly said.

Khoza is sticking with the story that he never planned to release the video of him and his girlfriend of less than two months, and that he has no idea how it ended up on the Internet in the first place, which is all well and good except now he can't use his penis. He reportedly must now pee from a tube and undergo surgery.

Still, Khoza won't press charges: ""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood,"" Khoza said. ""Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.""

1322,"Last week Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the company’s first smartwatch will go on sale in April 2015. This means that the company is tweaking its retail operations to incorporate an entirely new type of product. The more expensive models, particularly the gold Apple Watch Edition, which are expected to cost a couple of thousand dollars will be stored in special safes at Apple retail stores.
9to5Mac hears from sources that Apple retail stores will be fitted with special safes to secure inventory that’s to be sold as well as demo units from the show floor which will be kept in these safes overnight.
Apparently these safes will be equipped with chargers as well so that show floor units are good to go the next day. The report further claims that Apple has already fitted these safes at many of its stores.
It is likely that there will be a different sales process for the Apple Watch Edition models given that they’re likely to be very expensive. Perhaps Apple could provide an experience for this product that one would expect from a luxury watch boutique.

1324,"The masked terrorist — suspected of carrying out beheadings Western prisoners, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff — was injured in a bombing raid on Nov. 8, the Mail Online reported Saturday.

The bloodthirsty Islamic State executioner dubbed “Jihadi John” is said to have been wounded by U.S.-led air strike on the Iraqi-Syrian border, according to a report.

The masked terrorist — suspected of carrying out beheadings Western prisoners, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff — was injured in a bombing raid on Nov. 8, the Mail Online reported Saturday.

The Mail cited an unnamed nurse saying “Jihadi John” was among several Islamic State leaders wounded in the air strike in the western Iraqi town of Al Qaim.

The cold-blooded killer was among a group of high-level ISIS leaders meeting in an underground bunker targeted by U.S. and Iraqi bomber jets, Mail reported.

“Jihadi John,” who spoke with a British accent in the ISIS-released snuff videos, was said to have narrowly escaped with his life. He and others were treated at the Al Qaim General Hospital and then driven to Syria, a nurse told the Mail.

The nurse, among the emergency team that treated the wounded terrorists, also said that top ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was also wounded in the strike.

Earlier reports of Al-Baghadadi being killed or severely wounded in the air strike have been debunked. An audio tape emerged Thursday of Al-Baghdadi mentioning developments that have occurred since the Al Qaim air strike and imploring his followers to keep fighting “even if only one soldier remains.”

In a statement Saturday, the British Foreign Office could neither confirm nor deny the reports.

“We are aware of the reports,” the Foreign Office statement reads. “We cannot confirm these reports.”

1326,"Raven Symone didn’t file any “molestation charges” against Bill Cosby.

A bogus article was published on satire site Hip Hop Hangover.

“Another rape allegation has surfaced against famed comedian and actor, Bill Cosby. This time it is from a familiar face which speculates that there may be some truth to Cosby’s sketchy past,” it reads.

Hip Hop Hangover has a disclaimer, which says, “Hip Hop Hangover is a Gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only. Hip Hop Hangover is not intended for readers under 18 years of age.Hip Hop Hangover will use made up names in its posts except when public figures are satirized; Any use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

This means everything on the site is assuredly fake. All the stories on the website are bunk and there’s been no media coverage of Symone filing charges against anyone.

The bunk article also uses fake quotes from Symone’s lawyer.

Cosby has been accused by several women of sexual assault over a few decades.

Two women came out recently and said he assaulted them.

Joan Tarshis, a former actress, music industry publicist and journalist, spoke with CNN on Monday about Cosby.

“He’s a serial rapist,” she said. “Who would believe me? Bill Cosby, the all-American dad, the all-American husband, Mr. Jell-O, that everybody loved. Who would believe me? They would probably think I was out to get something,” she also wrote.

On The View, host Whoopi Goldberg expressed skepticism about the allegations against Cosby.

1345,"The story went like this: a young Argentinian man named Yair Tawil just turned 13 years old and was adopted by the country’s president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner. Why did she do it? It’s simple really. Due to Argentinian folklore, the president was required to adopt the boy in order to prevent him from turning into a werewolf. At least that’s what people believed. From New York Daily News:

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared “el lobison”.

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

A demon at midnight? Do tell…

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma. (Via)

The problem here is that all of it is bullsh*t. According to The Guardian, it is a nice mixture of folklore and truth that fooled plenty of people and may have had them running for the silver:

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson…

[Somehow], the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

That makes the entire thing infinitely less appealing. I’m disappointed now, and not just because I was ready to go get The Monster Squad together to test out my “nards” theory. Stupid facts, ruining a good story yet again. I bet science will be coming along shortly, via UBER no doubt, to add in an annoying truth to make werewolves even less cool.

According to Sky News, 5-year-old Alex Nash was invited to a friend’s birthday party at Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre.

The boy’s father, Derek Nash, said that he accepted the invitation, forgetting about a prior family commitment.

By the time he realized the mistake, Nash said he didn’t have any contact information for the woman.

When Alex returned to school, he was handed an envelope by a teacher.

Nash says the envelope contained a bill for a $24 “child’s party no-show fee.”

“I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words,” Nash told Sky News.

Nash says he is sorry for the mistake but will not be paying for a bill.

1350,"Reports appear to have stemmed from a hoax website

Reports that the world’s oldest tree has been accidentally chopped down by loggers in Peru has sparked panic among conservationists.

Several websites carried the “news” on Wednesday, seemingly without realising the entire story appears to be a hoax.

It first appeared on the World News Daily Report on Saturday – a fake news website carrying articles including “Isis launches satellite” and “Pterodactyl sighting in New Guinea terrorises villagers”.

The “Real or Satire” directory of news outlets describes it following “the old-school Tabloid-styled faux-journalism of its predecessors...you will find disclaimers neither revealing its satirical nature nor reveling in its journalistic integrity”.

Its “about us” section claims: “Our News Team is composed of award winning Christian, Muslim and Jewish journalists, retired Mossad agents and veterans of the Israeli Armed Forces.”

The World News Daily Report claimed that workers were logging deep in the Matsés Indigenous Reserve on the Peruvian and Brazilian border when they felled the ancient specimen.

“The giant Samauma tree that is thought to be over 5,800 years old judging on its concentric rings and estimated to be close to 40 meters in height was a major part of the native tribes cultural landscape,” the report said, quoting a supposed tribe leader.

An interview with a “researcher from the Rainforest Protection Coalition” lent the story credibility, testifying that the reserve is being exploited by energy corporations at the expense of the indigenous people.

While logging in the Matsés Indigenous Reserve is indeed controversial and the Amazon rainforest is shrinking, the Rainforest Protection Coalition does not exist.

Neither, we suspect, does tribal leader ""Tahuactep"", who is quoted in the story saying: “It is the Mother spirit of the rainforest, from this spirit-tree came the life force of all things living. They have destroyed Aotlcp-Awak, they have brought darkness upon not only our people, but the whole world.”",report appear stemmed hoax website report world oldest tree accidentally chopped logger peru sparked panic among conservationist several website carried news wednesday seemingly without realising entire story appears hoax first appeared world news daily report saturday fake news website carrying article including isi launch satellite pterodactyl sighting new guinea terrorises villager real satire directory news outlet describes following old school tabloid styled faux journalism predecessor find disclaimer neither revealing satirical nature reveling journalistic integrity u section claim news team composed award winning christian muslim jewish journalist retired mossad agent veteran israeli armed force world news daily report claimed worker logging deep mat indigenous reserve peruvian brazilian border felled ancient specimen giant samauma tree thought year old judging concentric ring estimated close meter height major part native tribe cultural landscape report said quoting supposed tribe leader interview researcher rainforest protection coalition lent story credibility testifying reserve exploited energy corporation expense indigenous people logging mat indigenous reserve indeed controversial amazon rainforest shrinking rainforest protection coalition exist neither suspect tribal leader tahuactep quoted story saying mother spirit rainforest spirit tree came life force thing living destroyed aotlcp awak brought darkness upon people whole world,samauma tree thought year old judging concentric ring estimated close meter height major part native tribe cultural landscape report said quoting supposed tribe leader interview researcher rainforest protection coalition lent story credibility testifying reserve exploited energy corporation expense indigenous people logging mat indigenous reserve indeed controversial amazon rainforest shrinking rainforest protection coalition exist neither suspect tribal leader tahuactep quoted story saying mother spirit rainforest spirit tree came life force thing living destroyed aotlcp awak brought darkness upon people whole world
1353,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not stepped out in public for weeks, with his officials citing an ""uncomfortable physical condition"".

But now rumours are circulating that the 31-year-old's weakness for cheese is to blame for a debilitating spell of gout which has rendered him immobile.

His last public appearance was on September 3, when he was spotted with a limp.

South Korean news agencies claim he also suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure.
Kim's grandfather Kim Il-sung reportedly had gout, which is a type of arthritis.

It can affect any joints but is most common in the big toe.

Diet can also play a big part, with alcohol and rich foods being the main culprits.

Gout is more common in men and attacks, which usually last between five and 15 days, can go away on their own.

But if left untreated it can lead to kidney stones and cardiovascular disease.

North Korean state media would not confirm the reports.

1354,"In the latest iPhone refresh, a lot changed. In addition to the screen size uptick, the overall design of the phones changed, bringing a more well-rounded (punny!) form factor, and slipping us away form the squared-off design of iPhones past. Still, one thing remained unanswered: how would Apple treat the smaller iPhones moving forward? The iPhone 5C is near its end of cycle, and the iPhone 5S will likely disappear next year. A new rumor suggests Apple is going to come back strong with a new 4-inch phone to replace them.



As we heard they might ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, a new (well, not sure I can really say that, but you get the point) iPhone is rumored to check in next year. With a 4-inch screen, it will keep Apple rooted to its one-handed past while we double-tap the home button to shrink screens on the larger phones.

The questions surrounding this are why, and how. Why would Apple create an entirely new -- but still smaller -- iPhone? How will they market it? Is it an emerging market flagship, or a budget-friendly offering for the US?

Let’s also keep in mind this is a rumor, and comes via a source we’re not familiar with. The “new iPhone” could even be an iPod refresh, instead of the “female friendly” iPhone the Chinese source claims.

As the Apple TV becomes more smart-home hub than streaming box, I’ve long held the position that a robust remote with the ability to run apps is a good idea, and the iPod fits that purpose nicely.

1366,"It was a really awful week to be one Chinese man's penis, according to a fantastical tale of dick butchery making its way around the internet.

Fan Lung, 32, was reportedly caught cheating with a younger woman after he used his wife's phone to send a message to his lover and ineptly forgot to log out afterward. His enraged wife, Feng, lopped off his dick with a pair of scissors, but doctors were able to reattach it after he was rushed to the hospital.

But Feng followed him, snuck into his hospital room while he was recovering from surgery, and cut his dick off again. And then, for good measure, she threw it out the window.

""The two subsequently clashed outside the facility, with a naked and bleeding Fan repeatedly beating his wife, until onlookers called the police,"" according to an AFP story.

The photos above allegedly show that fight.

It was sad, sad fate for Fan Lung's penis, which wasn't recovered, but a happy ending for Fan Lung, who will reportedly marry his mistress anyway.

""It doesn't matter if he turns out to be infertile, he has five children anyway,"" she's quoted as saying.

The legend of the double dismemberment comes from government-owned Chinese news agency HNR, which picked it up from China's hugely popular Twitter-like social network, Sina Weibo.

The story hasn't been entirely debunked, but it's dubious at best. Hoax-tracking site emergent.info points out that the Weibo account credited for the original photos has either been deleted or never existed at all.

But if you're an idealist in a this mad world full of penises that stay stubbornly, boringly attached to their owners, and you want to believe in revenge and true love, go right ahead.

1367,"A pregnant woman is now blind in her left eye after being hit by glass that shattered when police in Ferguson, Missouri, tackling Michael Brown protesters, shot at the window of the car she was in.

Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass.

Conner has lost sight in her left eye and has blurry vision in the other following the incident on Tuesday at New Halls Ferry Road.

Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass

Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety – but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them.

She told Kmov.com: ‘I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.’

Conner told the news channel that several police vehicles had blocked their exit from the gas station ‘from the side and the back’.

A non-lethal bean-bag round

A bean-bag round, or flexible baton round, is a projectile used by law enforcement officers to incapacitate suspects without killing them.

They are fired from a shotgun and take the form of lead shots housed in a small 'pillow'.

They are designed not to penetrate skin, but are capable of causing muscle spasms.

Deaths from bean bag rounds are rare. They have killed people in the past by causing internal bleeding, breaking the neck and even fatally damaging the heart by sending pieces of broken rib into it.

Shotguns with bean-bag rounds are normally colored bright orange to prevent lethal rounds being loaded.

Conner’s father, Donnell, said he was ‘very disappointed at police tactics’. He added: ‘There was no reason to fire upon an innocent person who was sitting in a vehicle.’

Her sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, said: ‘I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.’

Meanwhile, dozens of people have interrupted holiday shopping at major retail stores around the St. Louis area to speak out about a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown.

The protests began Thanksgiving night and continued early Friday. Protesters spent a few minutes at each store, shouting inside as law enforcement stood watch. There was no immediate word of any arrests.

According to Johnetta Elzie, who had been tweeting and posting videos of the protests, demonstrations occurred at a Wal-Mart and Target in Brentwood, two Wal-Marts in St. Charles and one Wal-Mart in Manchester.

In Ferguson, where Brown was shot on August 9, it was a quiet holiday night. There were no visible protests as the National Guard patrolled the area.

Earlier thousands of Walmart employees threatened to walk out from stores across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year.

Days after a grand jury decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson, demonstrators have led a campaign not to visit stores the day after Thanksgiving.

The group has used hashtags on social media such as #HandsUpDon'tSpend, in reference to the death of the teen in August, and #BlackOutBlackFriday.

Some demonstrators showed up outside Macy's in New York as crowds gathered to get an early jump on the sales.

Others in Ferguson walked through a Target store with their hands up, as unrest continued followed the controversial decision earlier this week.

1378,"ISIS militants are just one mile from Baghdad. The march into the largest city in the country comes on the heels of President Barack Obama admitting that the threat of the group was “underestimated.” The fighting near the city has become fierce, as reports from inside the Middle East region maintain the Islamic State fighters are just about to reach the doorstep of Baghdad.

The ISIS fighters have already garnered a large portion of both Iraq and Syria, but some experts fear that a takeover by the Islamic State in Baghdad could prove “disastrous” for the United States. Thwarting the reach of the group could prove significantly more difficult if Baghdad, with a population of about 7 million, falls under the complete control of ISIS.

“The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has,” Canon Andrew White, a priest leading the only Anglican church in the Iraq city, said.

“Obama says he overstated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to here a very short while to know that they can do very, very, little,” The Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East member added.

Islamic State militants took over the control of Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq. Massive fighting is still ongoing in Fallujah – a town about 25 miles away from Bagdad. BBC News is reporting that Iraqi troops are fighting ISIS militants approximately six miles away from Baghdad. If reports from the news agency are accurate, the Iraqi Army could “barely contain” the ISIS fighters or force a retreat even with the airstrikes offered by the United States.

During the 60 Minutes interview, President Obama had this to say about ISIS and the turmoil in the Middle East.

“During the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you had huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they [ISIS] were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos. [ISIS is] sort of a hybrid of not just the terrorist network, but one with territorial ambitions, and some of the strategy and tactics of an army.”

According to Obama administration military advisers, ISIS now numbers about 40,000 fighters – all of which have sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his plan to create an Islamic caliphate.

1381,"The NHL may be set to expand in a big, big way.

Sports Business News reported late Tuesday the league is preparing to add four teams by 2017 in Toronto, Quebec City, Seattle and Las Vegas.

Expansion fees could reach a combined $1.4 billion.

The number of NHL teams would increase to 34, including nine Canadian clubs.

Earlier Tuesday, a report in the Vancouver Province, citing sources close to the situation, said an expansion team in Sin City was a “done deal” and the only thing yet to be determined is who will front the ownership group.

The report also indicated any expansion plans might include more than two teams.

In May, Las Vegas officials broke ground on the building of a 20,000-seat multi-sport arena to be completed in spring 2016.

Construction on a $400 million, 18,000-seat arena in Quebec City is underway with a projected opening date of Sept. 2015. The rink is being built as part of a public-private partnership between the city and Quebecor Media, owner of QMI Agency, Sun Media and Sun News Network.The league has routinely denied any plans for expansion in recent years.

In spite of that, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly have reportedly had several meetings with city officials and potential ownership groups in Seattle.

Bettman has in the past admitted to receiving interest from groups in Seattle, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Quebec City.

“We’re listening, and that’s all we’re doing,” Bettman said in March. “We haven’t decided to engage in a formal expansion process at this point, but we’re listening. There is a lot of interest, and some of that’s a testament to the state of the game right now.”

1387,"Employer of 300,000 will separate its computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and services operations

Hewlett-Packard is planning to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The move, which could be announced on Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology’s most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112bn (£70bn) in revenue this fiscal year but has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing.

Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.

A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.

HP’s printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter’s financial results. It is not clear how many of HP’s staff –about 300,000 people – work in each of the planned businesses.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the personal computer revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing and has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

HP’s market value of $66bn is dwarfed by Apple Inc’s $596bn and Microsoft Corp’s $380bn.

It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is now the world’s number one, based on shipments. Dell, which is HP’s closest US competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.",employer separate computer printer business corporate hardware service operation hewlett packard planning split two company look put focus faster growing corporate service market according wall street journal report move could announced monday would monumental reshaping one technology important pioneer still employee track book bn bn revenue fiscal year struggled adapt new era mobile online computing reported plan hp separate computer printer business corporate hardware service operation spin unit tax free distribution share stockholder next year company spokeswoman declined comment report hp printing personal computing business account half revenue profit according last quarter financial result clear many hp staff people work planned business founded bill hewlett dave packard garage palo alto california hp one company shaped silicon valley personal computer revolution lately however struggled adapt shift towards mobile computing overshadowed younger rival hp market value bn dwarfed apple inc bn microsoft corp bn also overtaken aggressive chinese computer maker lenovo world number one based shipment dell hp closest u competitor facing similar pressure taken private founder michael dell last year,hp one company shaped silicon valley personal computer revolution lately however struggled adapt shift towards mobile computing overshadowed younger rival hp market value bn dwarfed apple inc bn microsoft corp bn also overtaken aggressive chinese computer maker lenovo world number one based shipment dell hp closest u competitor facing similar pressure taken private founder michael dell last year
1389,"A sickly stray cat that was taken in by a family in Canada is set to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Mittens was adopted by Colleen Clarke-Murphy and her family,who live in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, and when they took the cat to a veterinarian in October they for quite the surprise when they found out the cat was a hermaphrodite.

And since Clarke-Murphy already had a male cat, and Mittens has both genitalia, she decided she wanted a female cat.

Scroll down for video

Mittens (above) will be the first cat to undergo gender reassignment surgery

The cat is a hermaphrodite with both genitalia, and while new owner Colleen Clarke-Murphy (above) was hoping for a girl, they advised it would be best for Mittens to become a boy

'Did I just hear you right?' asked Clarke-Murphy to the vet after she was told the news.

She got another surprise soon after, when she learned the female cat she wanted was not in the animal's best interest according to her vet, and they would make the cat male.

'They're the ones who know what they're doing' Clarke-Murphy told CBC News.

'I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts.'

'I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.'

So then it was decided the cat would be spayed, neutered, and have reconstructive surgery.

The cost? $1500.

Money is not an object to Clarke-Murphy however when it comes to Mittens.

Mittens will now be spayed and neutered and then have reconstructive surgery

'She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter,' she said.

What's more, there are problems that come with the cat's current situation as it has bowel issues and problems urinating.

Now, a friend of Clarke-Murphy is auctioning off some items on Facebook to help pay the vet bill.",sickly stray cat taken family canada set undergo gender reassignment surgery mitten adopted colleen clarke murphy family live heart desire newfoundland took cat veterinarian october quite surprise found cat hermaphrodite since clarke murphy already male cat mitten genitalia decided wanted female cat scroll video mitten first cat undergo gender reassignment surgery cat hermaphrodite genitalia new owner colleen clarke murphy hoping girl advised would best mitten become boy hear right asked clarke murphy vet told news got another surprise soon learned female cat wanted animal best interest according vet would make cat male one know clarke murphy told cbc news mean really know like female really matter got part think got personality really matter decided cat would spayed neutered reconstructive surgery cost money object clarke murphy however come mitten mitten spayed neutered reconstructive surgery part family came home daughter said problem come cat current situation bowel issue problem urinating friend clarke murphy auctioning item facebook help pay vet bill,newfoundland took cat veterinarian october quite surprise found cat hermaphrodite since clarke murphy already male cat mitten genitalia decided wanted female cat scroll video mitten first cat undergo gender reassignment surgery cat hermaphrodite genitalia new owner colleen clarke murphy hoping girl advised would best mitten become boy hear right asked clarke murphy vet told news got another surprise soon learned female cat wanted animal best interest according vet would make cat male one know clarke
1390,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to acquire struggling social network Path, a source tells Michael Carney, a West Coast Editor at PandoDaily.

If Apple intends to acquire Path, known for its beautiful interface and nebulous business model, it would be the tech giant's latest attempt to gain a foothold in social. Apple has previously stumbled in this arena with a music-centric social network called Ping that went largely unused and was discontinued in 2012. So it makes sense that it might want to start with someone else's (quite functional and flashy looking) foundation to bring a native social experience to its iOS devices.

Path was founded in 2010 by ex-Facebooker Morin and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning. In five rounds of funding to date, the company has received $77 million in investments from 40 different investors.

Path was originally conceived as a companion network to Facebook for people to enjoy higher engagement with a smaller number of quality friends and contacts. It specifically limited users to 150 in-network connections as a tip of the hat to Dunbar's number, an idea in anthropology stating human brain size is such that we can only support meaningful relationships with 150 people. Where Facebook would be a place for wishing distant acquaintances a noncommittal happy birthday, Path would be specifically for sincere communications with your smaller, closer circle of friends and family.

The company released its app first on iPhone, later following up with apps for Android, Windows Phone and iPad. While it only boasts 25 million users (a far cry from the userbase of social giants like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat), the app is quite glamorous-looking and loaded with simple visual appeal. You might consider its news feed a list of stylized Facebook updates from people you actually want to hear from.

A screenshot of the Path iPad app.  Path

Apple and Path already have history together. Not only is Path's Morin a former Apple employee who worked in the company's marketing and product division from 2004-2006, but Path also made a fairly major error surrounding iOS user privacy in 2012. Its app uploaded iPhone users' complete contact lists to its servers, which led to Apple CEO Tim Cook responding to letters from the U.S. Congress about how Apple responds to user privacy. A second privacy flub in 2013 saw Path pay an $800,000 penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for storing information belonging to underage users; it agreed to independent privacy assessments every other year for the next 20 years.

Path has had its problems, but its product -- a walled garden for more-intimate socialization with your closest friends -- is strong and functional.

1394,"Apple rumors don’t stop, and today there’s a fresh one that discusses what we might be able to expect from the iPhone 6s later this year. Today’s rumors sound a bit outlandish, but not out of the question.

According to Money.UDN, the iPhone 6s will pack new camera features, including a dual-lens camera with a built-in optical zoom function. Optical zoom allows you to take clearer shots when zooming in on a subject, as opposed to software-enabled zoom which often leaves the subject looking blurry or grainy. Storage options may also change.

UDN cites supply chain sources who suggest Apple will continue to offer the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes, but will bump the entry-level iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s  Plus storage to 32GB instead of 16GB. There’s also reportedly some new display technology at work.

Another supply chain “legend” discussed by UDN suggests that the iPhone 6s will employ “two pressure sensors” one of which will have a role in health monitoringfunctions, offering more accurate ways to track a user’s heart rate and blood pressure. The site also lists a “3D pressure sensor” that may be built into the touch panel for an additional Z axis. To us, that suggests possible 3D user-interface interactions, though UDN instead points to 3D imaging technologies that might take advantage of the pressure sensor.

One of those rumors lines up with a patent Apple received in April of last year, which discussed presssure-sensitive touchscreen technology that allows the display to distinguish between soft taps and stronger, more forceful inputs; that technology is also making its way into the Apple Watch.

Wacky? Maybe a bit, and the supply chain is often filled with outlandish rumors but, again, none of this seems completely out of the question.

1396,"Fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive - after his Justin Bieber ringtone went off while he was being attacked by a bear.

Igor, 42, thought he was a goner when the brown bear pounced on him as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic.

But as the bear began to claw at him, Igor's mobile went off and the beast turned tail and fled back into the forest.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone - according to local media the singer's hit 'Baby' - must have startled the bear into halting its attack.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" explained one.

Igor suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.

Igor - now recovering from his mauling - explained: ""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.""

1399,"A scorpion stung a woman on an Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Saturday night, according to media reports from the West Coast.

The incident happened after the plane pulled back from the gate and was taxiing out, airline officials told ESPN. The aircraft returned to the gate so the woman could be treated.

The flight also happened to be carrying the Oregon State University men's basketball team, which was on its way back to Oregon after games in Los Angeles. Wayne Tinkle, Oregon State's head coach, tells ESPN the scorpion situation occurred just two rows in front of him.

""The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle tells ESPN's Andy Katz. ""The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.""

Tinkle's account mirrored other eyewitness descriptions.

""No one seemed frantic at all, not even the woman who was stung,"" passenger Mike Parker, a sports announcer for Oregon State, says to CNN. ""The flight attendants did a great job, as did the captain,"" said

As for the woman, she was treated by medical personnel for a sting on the arm, Alaska Airlines spokesman said Cole Cosgrove tells CNN. The woman declined additional treatment.

The Oregonian newspaper also confirms Tinkle's account of how the scorpion made it onto the aircraft, writing: ""Passengers were told the scorpion hitched a ride in the carry-on bag of a passenger who had been to Mexico.""

The flight was delayed by about 30 minutes to respond to the sting. Alaska Airlines officials tell ESPN that an attendant killed the scorpion and that the carrier would have an exterminator ""thoroughly check the plane"" upon arriving to Portland.

1409,"IBM is planning a massive reorganization that could see layoffs of as many as 110,000 workers beginning next week, according to a report in Forbes.

Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, author of The Decline and Fall of IBM, says the notices could go out as soon as next week after IBM reported shrinking profits for an 11th quarter.

IBM stock falls 7% after it downgrades earnings forecast
The tech giant, which relies on service contracts for a significant portion of its cash flow, is suffering as companies shut down their internal data centres and move services to the cloud.

IBM could lay off 26 per cent of its workforce of 430,000, which would mark the largest corporate layoff in history. Big Blue holds the previous record for huge cuts, after laying off 60,000 workers in 1993.


Cringely predicts the bulk of the layoffs will be in the U.S., and affect mainframe and storage divisions. Citing unnamed sources inside IBM, he says the company has been planning a reorganization dubbed Project Chrome to boost its earnings.

IBM recently announced the new Z13 mainframe, but that is unlikely to protect jobs in the mainframe division.

It also bought cloud services provider Softlayer and is opening cloud data centres around the world, including one in Canada, in an effort to move to a new business model. However, it is behind rivals such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon in adapting to cloud computing.

Cloud offerings at IBM are expected to bring in $3.1 billion on an annualized basis in 2014, only a fraction of IBM’s total $100 billion in revenue last year.

1411,"No one knows exactly where he came from. No one knows why he was chosen to lead the Islamic State. And now, in the past 24 hours, reports have arrived saying Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is “believed dead,” or merely wounded, or “critically wounded,” or unscathed — or possibly not even at the scene of the attack.

Following U.S. airstrikes targeting Islamic State commanders attending a clandestine meeting over the weekend, few reports agree on the facts. Meanwhile, American commanders can’t or won’t say whether or not he was even there or not, let alone hurt.

The drama and ensuing confusion is fitting for Baghdadi, a shadowy figure whose myth may only be enhanced by the mystery surrounding his purported demise.

The saga deepened on Sunday when Iraqi Defense Minister said on Facebook that Baghdadi’s deputy was killed and that the self-described caliph was injured in the attack. Then Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said to be the Islamic State’s spokesman, dispatched his own update. “Perhaps you suspected that the Caliphate ended with martyrdom of the Caliph,” the Jerusalem Post quoted him saying. “I assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank god, and I wish him a speedy recovery,” the implication being that he was at least injured.

If so, he would have escaped a fate that claimed other prominent Islamic leaders. The assassinations began in 2006. That year, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of an earlier iteration of the Islamic State, was killed when U.S. warplanes dropped two 500-pound bombs on a house in which he met with other insurgency figures. Four years later, an Iraqi-American operation unleashed a barrage on a building in Tikrit, Iraq, killing the group’s top two leaders and ushering in the tenure of an unknown figure named Baghdadi.

Not surprisingly, those killings made Baghdadi risk-averse and even more inclined than other militant leaders to a life inhabited in the shadows. But while the leader’s aversion to the public eye has protected Baghdadi, it has also allowed facts to melt into Islamic State propaganda, forging an identity that has become one of the most potent recruiting devices at the Islamic State’s disposal.

The pitch: Baghdadi is a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, holds a doctorate in Islamic studies and envisions a Sunni-dominated caliphate that spans continents. It’s a carefully crafted story that separates the Islamic State from nearly every other Islamic militant movement — evidenced when fighters of the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda offshoot battling in Syria, wanted to defect to the Islamic State. All they had to do, reported the New York Times, was make a few phone calls, pledge allegiance to Baghdadi and their new life would begin.

The mystique of Baghdadi, experts suggest, would make him all the more difficult to replace and his loss all the more significant. “The wounding and potential loss of Baghdadi may be of more significance for his followers” than adherents of other jihadist groups, wrote Theodore Karasik, senior adviser to the company, Risk Insurance Management: “Baghdadi, as ‘Caliph Ibrahim,’ to maintain his religious foundation, needs to be of a whole body. If he loses a limb in his injuries, his credibility suffers. If he dies, the death would toss the entire concept of the legitimacy of the ‘Caliphate’ on its head.”

Using another name for the Islamic State, Karasik added: “ISIS discourse will likely need to be revised.”

So if Baghdadi survived the American bombardment, he may retreat further into darkness. That’s where he’s most comfortable operating, reported the Soufan Group: “He is intensely careful about his security … when commanders below the leadership level were called to meet him, it is said that they would be told he was present in the group but without his identity being specified.” Other reports said he wears masks when meeting prisoners to obscure his identity, earning the nickname of the “invisible sheik.”

When Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in Mosul on July 4, 2014, it marked the first time many people had gotten a good look at him. Before that appearance, there had only been two confirmed pictures him. And such “obscurity,” a Soufan report said, “may have provided [him] an advantage.”

Indeed, tracking his movements has been difficult in the black hole of Syria, where U.S. officials fumble around without a stable of contacts and intelligence services available in Iraq, according to a Foreign Policy report. “The same thing is needed to hunt down Baghdadi,” Thomas Sanderson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the magazine. “When you kill the leader, it demonstrates that anyone is vulnerable.”

Making the challenge more difficult: The Islamic State has altered its tactics. U.S. airstrikes have forced it hide its fighters among local communities and cities, Foreign Policy said, and stop moving its soldiers in large convoys. “They have gone to ground inside cities and this makes decapitation strikes very difficult,” David E. Johnson, a Rand military expert, said. “You can’t kill them if you can’t find them.”

And few are more difficult to find than Baghdadi.",one know exactly came one know chosen lead islamic state past hour report arrived saying abu bakr al baghdadi believed dead merely wounded critically wounded unscathed possibly even scene attack following u airstrikes targeting islamic state commander attending clandestine meeting weekend report agree fact meanwhile american commander say whether even let alone hurt drama ensuing confusion fitting baghdadi shadowy figure whose myth may enhanced mystery surrounding purported demise saga deepened sunday iraqi defense minister said facebook baghdadi deputy killed self described caliph injured attack abu muhammad al adnani said islamic state spokesman dispatched update perhaps suspected caliphate ended martyrdom caliph jerusalem post quoted saying assure islamic nation emir abu bakr al baghdadi well thank god wish speedy recovery implication least injured would escaped fate claimed prominent islamic leader assassination began year abu musab al zarqawi leader earlier iteration islamic state killed u warplane dropped two pound bomb house met insurgency figure four year later iraqi american operation unleashed barrage building tikrit iraq killing group top two leader ushering tenure unknown figure named baghdadi surprisingly killing made baghdadi risk averse even inclined militant leader life inhabited shadow leader aversion public eye protected baghdadi also allowed fact melt islamic state propaganda forging identity become one potent recruiting device islamic state disposal pitch baghdadi direct descendant prophet muhammad hold doctorate islamic study envisions sunni dominated caliphate span continent carefully crafted story separate islamic state nearly every islamic militant movement evidenced fighter nusra front al qaeda offshoot battling syria wanted defect islamic state reported new york time make phone call pledge allegiance baghdadi new life would begin mystique baghdadi expert suggest would make difficult replace loss significant wounding potential loss baghdadi may significance follower adherent jihadist group wrote theodore karasik senior adviser company risk insurance management baghdadi caliph ibrahim maintain religious foundation need whole body loses limb injury credibility suffers dy death would toss entire concept legitimacy caliphate head using another name islamic state karasik added isi discourse likely need revised baghdadi survived american bombardment may retreat darkness comfortable operating reported soufan group intensely careful security commander leadership level called meet said would told present group without identity specified report said wear mask meeting prisoner obscure identity earning nickname invisible sheik baghdadi delivered sermon mosque mosul july marked first time many people gotten good look appearance two confirmed picture obscurity soufan report said may provided advantage indeed tracking movement difficult black hole syria u official fumble around without stable contact intelligence service available iraq according foreign policy report thing needed hunt baghdadi thomas sanderson senior fellow center strategic international study told magazine kill leader demonstrates anyone vulnerable making challenge difficult islamic state altered tactic u airstrikes forced hide fighter among local community city foreign policy said stop moving soldier large convoy gone ground inside city make decapitation strike difficult david e johnson rand military expert said kill find difficult find baghdadi,iraqi defense minister said facebook baghdadi deputy killed self described caliph injured attack abu muhammad al adnani said u airstrikes targeting islamic state commander attending clandestine meeting weekend report agree fact meanwhile american commander say whether even let alone hurt drama ensuing confusion fitting baghdadi shadowy figure whose myth may enhanced mystery surrounding purported demise saga deepened sunday iraqi defense minister said facebook baghdadi deputy
1414,"It looks like Apple's 12.9-inch iPad has been delayed.

The heavily rumored large-screen iPad, sometimes referred to as an ""iPad Pro,"" was initially reported to be launching in the first quarter of 2015.

A new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via Apple Insider) says Apple has faced delays on its 12.9-inch iPad, which will push the launch into the second quarter of 2015.

It's important to note that Kuo has a stellar track record when it comes to Apple, which means this is likely more than just a rumor.

The tablet's delay reportedly stems from the type of display that Apple intends to use in the tablet, which will utilize newer LCD technologies for faster response times and higher color saturation, according to Kuo.

1421,"The tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a century

The President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.

Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.

A cryptic tweet posted on an unverified Twitter account in Lisa Bonet‘s name, that was construed as a veiled comment about sexual misconduct allegations surrounding Bill Cosby was a hoax, according to the actress’ manager.

“I can assure you that is not her Twitter account and I have had the account suspended,” talent manager Jillian Neal told TheWrap Sunday.

It got picked up by several news organizations and attributed to Bonet, who played Cosby's daughter, Denise Huxtable, on hit NBC series “The Cosby Show.”

More than a dozen women, including former model Janice Dickinson, have come forward to accuse the 77-year-old TV legend of sexual misconduct and in some cases rape.

Cosby has lost a series of gigs since the accusations began to mount. NBC decided not to go forward with a proposed comedy series that would have starred the Emmy Award-winning comedian.

Netflix pulled his comedy special, “Bill Cosby 77,” which was slated to premiere over the Thanksgiving holiday.

TV Land dropped repeats of “The Cosby Show.” And his scheduled performances at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, as well as the Diamond Desert Casino in Arizona, were canceled.

He did not touch the allegations during his set. But he did refer to the situation in an interview with Florida Today.

“I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos,” Cosby said. “People should fact check. People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos.”

1431,"The details behind the medical treat of Joan Rivers have been trickling out since her passing almost two weeks ago. CNN is reporting some shocking details tonight revolving around witness claims that Rivers’ personal doctor allgedly took a selfie and biopsied the comedian before the cardiac arrest that sent her to hospital, eventually ending her life. From CNN:

A staff member at Manhattan’s Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

After Cohen, the clinic’s medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.

Cohen has already stepped down from his position at the endoscopy clinic where the incident took place, but the identity of the other doctor has not been released.

Even with these details, the Yorkville Clinic is claiming that the biopsy did not cause Rivers’ death and that their doctors were certified. If these new revelations prove to be true though, it would cast doubt on those claims. You could probably even say that the fact the biopsy happened at all is enough to cast a shadow over everything.

A wedding punch-up was sparked when a bride opted to marry a guest instead after her husband-to-be had an epileptic fit during the ceremony.

Jugal Kishore, 25, and 23-year-old bride Indira were about to perform the traditional 'varmala' ceremony during their Hindu wedding, when he suddenly fell ill.

Kishore fell to the ground as he extended his arms to exchange garlands with his bride.

But Indira, angry that her family had not been told of Kishore's epilepsy, decided to marry one of her wedding guests instead...Harpal Singh, her sister's brother-in-law.

Singh and Indira exchanged garlands in the traditional way in front of the guests, as Kishore, was taken to a doctor for treatment.

When he returned to the wedding venue, he found that his wife-to-be was now married to someone else.

Kishore pleaded with Indira, to change her mind, but she stood firm - sparking a punch-up between guests, involving spoons, plates and dishes, the Times of India reports.

Police in Rampur district of India, said they had detained several people who were there at the wedding.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" an officer said.

""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.""

1440,"This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson.

Manson’s engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book.

Manson’s fiancée, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone.

Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Manson’s remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money.

But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. “He’s finally realized that he’s been played for a fool,” Simone said.

Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. “He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

Manson’s and Burton’s marriage license expired Thursday. “They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months,” says a statement posted on Burton’s and Hammond’s website.

Burton and Hammond — who uses the nickname Gray Wolf — could not be reached for comment.

The wedding was postponed “due to an unexpected interruption in logistics,” the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said.

California prison officials would not comment on either Manson’s medical condition or his whereabouts.

Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, “The Retrial of Charles Manson.” Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail.

According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Manson’s corpse about two years ago.

Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies.

“He didn’t give them a yes, he didn’t give them a no. He sort of strung them along,” Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said.

When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says.

If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Manson’s remains upon his death, Simone said.

Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. “Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,” he said.

Another Simone book, “The Lufthansa Heist,” about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with “Good­Fellas” mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012.",plot crazy even charles manson manson engagement woman year junior part wild scheme profit putting body public display death say author upcoming book manson fianc e year old afton elaine burton known star sought wed convicted mastermind sharon tate murder eight slaying could gain possession corpse according journalist daniel simone burton pal craig hammond planned lay manson remains glass crypt simone say pair figured bizarre california version lenin tomb would draw huge crowd make big money manson want marry burton interest spending eternity displayed glass coffin simone told post finally realized played fool simone said another reason madman balked plan belief immortal feel never die simone said therefore feel stupid idea begin manson burton marriage license expired thursday plan renewing license thing move forward coming month say statement posted burton hammond website burton hammond us nickname gray wolf could reached comment wedding postponed due unexpected interruption logistics site say manson entered prison medical facility treatment infection two month ago receive visitor simone said california prison official would comment either manson medical condition whereabouts simone collaborator heidi jordan ley seeking publisher book retrial charles manson manson inmate corcoran state prison california helping project author say spoke manson regularly phone privilege suspended two year ago also corresponded manson inmate friend mail according author burton hammond hatched plan display manson corpse two year ago initially duo asked manson sign document would let take body dy give yes give sort strung along simone said burton hammond regularly brought manson toiletry item stringing along kept goody coming simone said became clear last year purportedly death proof manson would green light plan burton hammond switched marriage idea simone say burton married manson pair realized california law would give possession manson remains upon death simone said simone belief manson never intended marry burton manson never consented wedding first place never said another simone book lufthansa heist million armed robbery kennedy airport due next month co authored good fella mobster henry hill died,convicted mastermind sharon tate murder eight slayings could gain possession corpse according to journalist daniel simone burton pal craig hammond planned lay manson remains glass crypt simone say pair figured bizarre manson burton marriage license expired thursday plan renewing license thing move forward coming month say statement posted burton hammond website burton hammond us nickname gray wolf could reached comment wedding postponed due unexpected interruption

1443,"The NHL is considering expanding by as many as four teams, according to a pair of reports, with Toronto and Quebec City in the mix to land new franchises.

Howard Bloom of Sports Business News tweeted that the league will add four franchises ""by 2017"" in Toronto, Quebec City, Las Vegas and Seattle.

Bloom added that the NHL would take in $1.4 billion in expansion fees with the deals.

Also on Tuesday, Tony Gallagher of the Province, based in Vancouver, reported that an NHL team in Las Vegas is a ""done deal,"" according to ""sources close to the situation.""

However, French-language TVA Sports reported that NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly denied the league is looking to expand.

""It's not in our plans,"" TVA Sports quoted Daly as saying in French. ""There is absolutely nothing new on that.""

The NHL hasn't expanded since the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild joined for the 2000-01 season.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who has previously dismissed talk of expanding beyond the league's 30 teams, visited Seattle in May for an update on a proposed new arena.

In July, former NHL great Wayne Gretzky's agent denied a report that his client is among a group of investors looking to bring a team to the city.

Toronto and Quebec City have long been considered candidates if the NHL decides to expand beyond the seven Canadian-based clubs in operation.

Quebec City hasn't had an NHL team since the Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995.

Toronto, of course, is already home to the Maple Leafs, but it's possible that Canada's most populous city could support a second team, whether in the city proper or the surrounding suburbs.

Markham, Ont., just north of Toronto, has flirted with the idea of funding the construction of an NHL-sized arena, but those plans have stalled.

Arid Las Vegas may seem like an odd place for a hockey team, but the Twitter account attributed to Panthers goalie Roberto Luongo suggested a sizable home-ice advantage could be enjoyed against weary visitors to Sin City.

1444,"(Updates with victim killing scorpion) By Kevin Murphy Feb 15 (Reuters) - A scorpion stung a passenger on an Alaska Airlines flight to Portland, Oregon, delaying a flight that originated in Mexico, the carrier said on Sunday. Flight 567, which originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, was taxiing for takeoff on Saturday at Los Angeles International Airport when the woman was stung, airline spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, where medics treated the woman and offered additional medical treatment, which she declined, Cosgrove said. She did not get back on the plane, he said. Passengers stayed on board, he said. The woman brushed the scorpion away after the sting and killed it on the floor with her foot, Cosgrove said. The crew of the Boeing 737 checked for other scorpions and the plane departed about 50 minutes late, he said. ""We don't know exactly how the scorpion made it on the plane, but the flight did originate in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are known to live,"" Cosgrove said. The airline was reaching out to the woman on Sunday regarding possible compensation for her inconvenience and to check on her condition, Cosgrove said. Only about 30 of about 1,500 species of scorpions can cause potentially fatal stings, according the website of the Mayo Clinic. ""Scorpion stings, although painful, are mostly harmless,"" a clinic posting said.

1445,"Saudi Arabia’s national airline carrier is planning to introduce gender segregation aboard its flights following complaints from passengers who refused to have random males seated next to their wives, the Kingdom’s media report.

Airline company Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women separated onboard, unless they are close relatives, the Emirates247 news website reported.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, according to Saudi daily Ajel.


Saudia's traveling policies are already in accord with the strict Islam practices of Saudi Arabia. For instance, in addition to the routine boarding announcements at the Kingdom’s airports, a prayer or verse from the Quran is read prior to take off. Furthermore, international flights usually have a specially designated men’s prayer area to accommodate 5 daily prayers. In addition, the airline does not offer any beverages or dishes which contain alcohol or pork products. And the onboard entertainment menu does not offer any movies with adult content.


The Kingdom itself is infamous for gender segregation in everyday matters of society. For instance, women typically require male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. Saudi women are also not employed as stewardesses on Saudi Arabia’s national carrier. That role is reserved for women of other nationalities.

Ironically enough, Israel too is battling the same problem, as many ultra-orthodox Jews refuse to share their transit time with female companions. A flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed by half an hour in late December after a group of male Jewish passengers onboard a Delta flight refused to sit next to women.


In October, on the eve of the Jewish festival Rosh Hashana, ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men left the plane before take-off, also between New York and Tel Aviv, again refusing to sit next to women. In an incident in September, Israeli carrier El Al flight was postponed by 11-hours after a group of Haredi passengers refused to sit next to women.

1448,"The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that President Putin’s order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is “intensely/directly related” to a “missing”, and believed stolen, low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson, Colorado, which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs.

According to the SVR, the atomic weapon missing from Fort Carson has been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 845.82 mm (33.3 inches) long.

This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models, Mod 0 and Mod 1, which weighed 53.5 and 58 kg (118 and 128 pounds) respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0.072 kiloton (72 tons of TNT).

Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been “retired” by 1992, this report says, the SVR has long noted their continued “use for training” by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex, all of whom are located in El Paso County, Colorado.

The specific US weapons platform designed to fire the W48, this report notes, is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System [3rd photo left] which is currently operated by  forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.

Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell “disappeared”, this report continues, the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center, in California, which will span much of November, after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide.

US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are “nonexistent”, this report further notes, other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a “total lockdown” as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost ""sensitive item"", a term they use that refers to gear including weapons, ammunition and night vision goggles - items that cause high-level concern when missing.

These media reports further report that whatever is missing, it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carson's gates yesterday and their spokesman stating: “As part of random searches at the gate, we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation.”

Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell, SVR intelligence analysts in this report state, is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named “nukes on the loose” and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic “dirty bomb” that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis.

London’s Telegraph News Service in their report on this “nukes on the loose” war game further noted:

“David Cameron joined Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a ""nukes on the loose"" war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack.  The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.”

Of equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.

In his warning Dr. Roberts stated: “Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as ‘What’s the good of nuclear weapons if you can’t use them.”

With the “suicidal tendencies” of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russia’s near record de-Dollarization efforts, when coupled with the “secret deal” between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria, point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapse…and all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath….including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.

1449,"The Islamic State is attempting to sell the body of dead U.S. hostage James Foley for $1 million, multiple sources told BuzzFeed in a report published Wednesday night.

The unidentified sources, described by BuzzFeed as middlemen with ties to the terror group, said the Islamic State is looking for the money in exchange for Foley’s remains.

Foley was beheaded by the terror group earlier this year. A video titled “A Message to America” was posted online in mid-August showing the photojournalist being killed by a militant.

In this photo taken Oct. 28, 2014, two Jordanian men walk past graffiti depicting the flag of the Islamic State group with Arabic that reads, “There is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet,” in the city of Ma’an, Jordan. (AP Photo/Nasser Nasser)

One of the sources said he was approached by an Islamic State leader who asked him to work on a possible deal with either the U.S. government or Foley’s family.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” he told BuzzFeed. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

The middleman added that he was motivated by a desire to help provide closure to Foley’s family and described his work as “a humanity case.”

A representative for the State Department told BuzzFeed they are “seeking more information” on the report. A senior U.S. diplomat added that the idea, if true, is “disgusting.”

1450,"Technology giant Hewlett-Packard, known as HP, is to split itself into two separate companies.

The US firm will separate its better-performing computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and services operations.

Shareholders will be given a stake in both businesses.

The split is part of a radical restructuring plan, which has already resulted in tens of thousands of job cuts in recent years.

The firm is now in the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan, aimed at helping the firm adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing.

Current chief executive Meg Whitman, who has the job of reviving the fortunes of the 75-year-old firm, will head the new spin-off, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

This will house the corporate hardware and services operations.

She will also be chairman of HP's printing and PC business, HP Inc, which last quarter accounted for about half its revenue and profit.

Ms Whitman said the split would give both firms the ""flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics"".

""We can [now] more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,"" she added.

HP said it expected the division to be complete by the end of the 2015 financial year.

Business pressures

The division of HP's businesses comes at a time when other large tech firms are being urged to break up.

Last week, online auction site eBay announced it was splitting off its payments system PayPal into a separate company.

HP has been under pressure from newer rivals such as Chinese firm Lenovo, which overtook HP as the world's largest PC maker in 2012. Third-ranked US rival Dell was taken private last year.

1451,"Just after 12 pm on Tuesday, a story started picking up some serious online momentum.

In the span of about an hour, it appeared on the websites of The Week, Elite Daily, the Daily Mirror, the New York Post, Mediaite, an ABC affiliate, among others.

Here’s how the New York Post’s story began:

Even bears can’t stand Justin Bieber’s music.
A fisherman in Russia was being attacked by a brown bear and escaped death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and sent the beast fleeing into the forest.
Animals? Check. A strange and amazing turn of events? Check. Justin Bieber angle when he’s already in the news for a run-in with Orlando Bloom? Check.

Too good to check? Check.

But next thing you know, NPR’s “Morning Edition” covers it, and it ends up in a Seth Meyers monologue:

Here’s the issue: the first story of the bear attack was published in Russian language publication Pravda back on July 31 — and it says nothing about Justin Bieber.

At some point in making the leap to English, someone added a detail to the story that transformed it into a viral hit. According to Google Translate, the original Russian version said the bear was scared away when Igor Vorozhbitsyn’s phone began speaking out the current time. So, yes, the phone apparently scared off the bear mid-mauling. But no Bieber.

Did Vorozhbitsyn change his story in a subsequent interview and realize it was Bieber all along?

Or did someone insert a seemingly false Justin Bieber angle into the story?

Point of Bieberfication

The bear-and-Bieber stories all carried the same pictures of Vorozhbitsyn. They had the same quotes of him explaining that his granddaughter had put the ringtone on his phone.

They quote the same “wildlife expert”: “Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear.”

Hey, thanks for that too-perfect quote to round out the story, anonymous wildlife expert with no credentials!

The symmetry in the stories is because they all used the information contained in a single English language report from a site called the Austrian Times. It’s led by a Brit named Michael Leidig, who also owns the Central European News agency. (His name is listed in the domain owership records for the sites, as well as for CEN’s affiliate agency, EuroPics.)

After the Austrian Times/CEN published the story, it spread to MailOnline.

Once MailOnline had it, the story was off and running. Bieber and the bear was the real deal, and everyone wanted to plant a flag on it. As of this writing, MailOnline’s story has racked up over 13,000 shares.

The images are the first clue as to where the story really came from. MailOnline cited CEN as the copyright holder of the image it used. But the Austrian Times story credits Pravda with the image on its story. A search on the Pravda website turned up the original article with its images and Bieber-less reporting.

So how did the Austrian Times learn of the Bieber angle that Pravda apparently missed?

No answer from Austrian Times/CEN/EuroPics

I called the offices of the Austrian Times and first asked to speak with David Rogers, who is the only person listed on the site. (He is both its ombudsman and its primary sales contact.)

I spoke with a woman who said Rogers was not in the office. When I asked about the story, she said she would follow up with their office in Russia to get the details and would call me back. I asked if their office there typically rewrites things from wires and local press.

“A lot of stories are found on the wire or in local media but also from local interviews on the ground, or we speak to the reporters who wrote them; we speak to police to get things confirmed,” she said.

I called her again later that day to ask if she had news from the Russian office, and she said they are often hard to get ahold of. She never got back to me.

I also called and emailed Leidig, owner of both the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics. A man who answered the phone at the CEN office said Leidig is on vacation in Romania.

Leidig, who has lived in Austria for some time, says nothing about himself on the CEN or Times websites, but he has an extensive Wikipedia page. In the section about CEN, it lists MailOnline as one of its clients, though that and much of the page itself offers no citation for the claim. (In 2013, Leidig self-published a book about Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.)

Along with detailing Leidig’s journalistic achievements, the Wikipedia page includes this passage:

Leidig is also a campaigner for greater support for journalism which he describes as the “coalface of democracy.” He has campaigned in favour of more responsibility from search engines like Google to give credit to original source material and also for payment for originators of news, arguing that if the journalists all go out of business nobody will provide the content worth having.
The sole link in that passage goes to… an article on the Austrian Times. Still, one would hope Pravda is therefore earning some revenue from the story and images that CEN and the Austrian Times plucked from its site. (I contacted Pravda to ask about the images and the story, but have not yet heard back.)

For their part, the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics have stopped talking to me. After receiving no information from their Russian bureau, I sent a detailed email Thursday with questions about the Bieber version of the Pravda story and its use — and possible resale — of Pravda images.

1452,"LOS ANGELES (CBS Seattle/AP) — A scorpion stung a woman on the hand just before her flight from Los Angeles to Portland took off.
Flight 567 was taxiing on the runway Saturday night when the passenger was stung, Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, and the woman was checked by medics. She refused additional medical treatment, but she didn’t get back on the plane.
The woman stomped the scorpion to death, and flight attendants checked overhead compartments for any additional unwanted arachnids, Cosgrove said. It’s unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are common, he said.
The flight then took off at 8:40 p.m., about an hour late.
Members of Oregon State University’s men’s basketball team were on the flight, Cosgrove said.  The team was returning home after losing to USC 68-55.
Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.
“The plane was coming from Mexico before us and the scorpion was on the plane,” Tinkle said.  “The woman was a real champ.  She acted like it was a mosquito bite.

1454,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

1456,"It’s enough to scare someone off of having children.

Whether it’s gluten or plastics or peanuts, it seems young and new parents have more and more social taboos to navigate.

The latest parenting taboo? Missing a birthday party — or sending an invoice to the absent child’s parents, depending on how you look at it.

A pair of British parents are still reeling from the discovery of an invoice for £15.95 (just under $29 Canadian) in their five-year-old son Alex’s backpack. Their crime? Not informing the parents of his classmate their son would not be attending a birthday party in December.



Julie Lawrence, the birthday boy’s mother, has defended the “fee” as necessary to recoup the costs associated with a no-show. She said Alex told her son he would attend the party and took that as proper confirmation. She said the cost covers one ticket to the “child’s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch.”

Lawrence has also threatened to take the Nash family to small claims court if they don’t pay up.

Nash has said he understood the financial concerns and said it was the way Lawrence went about it that offended. They have also taken the issue up with the school, because it allowed Lawrence to place the brown envelope in Alex’s backpack, which is against school policy.

So where was Alex? Out with his grandparents, whom he chose over the party when his parents realized he was double booked for the day and it was the only chance he would have to see them before Christmas.

Alex’s mom, Tanya Nash, explained this to Lawrence in a Facebook exchange printed by the Plymouth Herald, the local paper that first broke the story. The ensuing Facebook debate between the two mothers now has parents around the world chiming in.


If Lawrence’s side of the story seems reasonable — she did have to pay for Alex when he didn’t show up after all — the Facebook conversation takes quite the turn. The moms’ fight about whether or not they had each other’s number and who was ruder in how they approached the other parent.

“This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable,” Lawrence writes.

Nash responds that she can’t think of another party Alex missed where there was a formal invite, and the pushes back against Lawrence’s tone: “Exactly what lesson would I be learning? I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.”",enough scare someone child whether gluten plastic peanut seems young new parent social taboo navigate latest parenting taboo missing birthday party sending invoice absent child parent depending look pair british parent still reeling discovery invoice canadian five year old son alex backpack crime informing parent classmate son would attending birthday party december julie lawrence birthday boy mother defended fee necessary recoup cost associated show said alex told son would attend party took proper confirmation said cost cover one ticket child party ski slope including snow tubing tobogganing lunch lawrence also threatened take nash family small claim court pay nash said understood financial concern said way lawrence went offended also taken issue school allowed lawrence place brown envelope alex backpack school policy alex grandparent chose party parent realized double booked day chance would see christmas alex mom tanya nash explained lawrence facebook exchange printed plymouth herald local paper first broke story ensuing facebook debate two mother parent around world chiming lawrence side story seems reasonable pay alex show facebook conversation take quite turn mom fight whether number ruder approached parent first time alex turned party invited either amicable way round believe would pay money let lesson learnt hope agreeable lawrence writes nash responds think another party alex missed formal invite push back lawrence tone exactly lesson would learning child please speak like one answer question unfortunately agreeable,nash said understood financial concern said way lawrence went offended also threatened take nash family small claim court pay nash said understood financial concern said way lawrence went offended also threatened take nash family small claim court pay nash said understood financial concern said way lawrence went offended also threatened take nash family small claim court pay nash said understood financial concern said way lawrence went offended also threatened take nash family small claim court pay nash said understood financial concern said
1460,"Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner has a pretty solid plan for keeping her country safe from werewolves: She's going to adopt them.

There's apparently an obscure bit of Argentinian folklore that states the seventh son born to a family will turn into the feared el lobison on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday. The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form.

Other fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they're unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting.

The fear of el lobison's curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned – or in some cases murdered – their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Perón, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.




This year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family ""marvelous,"" described Yair as ""a total sweetie,"" and bestowed the presidential nickname of ""Queen Esther"" on Nehama. (Shlomo and Nehama had sent in their request back in 1993.)",argentina president christina fern ndez de kirchner pretty solid plan keeping country safe werewolf going adopt apparently obscure bit argentinian folklore state seventh son born family turn feared el lobison first friday boy th birthday myth predicts child transform creature midnight full moon eternally damned ravage countryside returning human form fun bit el lobison trivia per independent feed excrement unbaptized baby flesh recently dead unnaturally strong spread curse biting fear el lobison curse strong argentina family abandoned case murdered seventh son th century tradition sitting president adopting one child came pas formally decreed president juan domingo per n extended baby girl time adopted gain sitting president official godparent gold medal full educational scholarship year kirchner adopted first jewish seventh son yair tawil practice extended catholic child kirchner met yair parent shlomo nehama dec called family marvelous described yair total sweetie bestowed presidential nickname queen esther nehama shlomo nehama sent request back,argentina president christina fern ndez de kirchner pretty solid plan keeping country safe werewolf going adopt apparently obscure bit argentinian folklore state seventh son born family turn feared el lobison first friday boy th birthday myth predicts child transform creature midnight full moon eternally damned ravage countryside returning human form fun bit el lobison trivia per independent feed excrement unbaptized baby flesh recently dead unnaturally strong spread curse bit
1464,"According to this 'news' report, which is circulating via social media, DNA testing has confirmed that Michael Jackson is the biological father of American singer Bruno Mars.

Supposedly, Bruno's publicist Vladimir Kershov leaked the private information and was subsequently fired for his actions.  But, claims the article, Bruno's new publicist has nevertheless confirmed that Michael Jackson is indeed Bruno's father.

However, the claims in the story are untrue. No such private information was leaked and there are no credible reports that support the claims.

The bogus story comes from the fake-news website Empire News. Empire News considers itself satirical.  The site includes the following disclaimer:

Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the Journal said in a report on its web site that cited people familiar with the matter. The division would be made through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year, according to the report.

A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.

HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the newspaper noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.

1475,"ISIS terrorists released a video Tuesday that claims to show the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

In the video titled “A second message to America,’’ Sotloff, 31, of Florida can be seen kneeling in orange garb in front of a black-cloaked executioner following news footage of President Obama taking tough about the terror group.

Sotloff says into the camera that he is “paying the price’’ for US intervention in Syria.

“I am Stephen Joel Sotloff, I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now, and why I am appearing before you. And now it is time for my message,’’ he says.

“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests. So why is it that I am having to pay the price of your interference with my life? Am I not an American citizen?

“You have spent billions of US taxpayers dollars, and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State. So where is the American interest in reigniting this war?

“From what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time where you couldn’t win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo,’’ Sotloff says.

“Here you are now Obama, nearing the end of your term and having achieved none of the above and deceivingly marching us, the American people into a blazing fire.”

The masked ISIS killer adds in a British accent, “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.

“Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

It’s unclear if the executioner is the same fiend who beheaded James Wright Foley on video two weeks ago.

As Sotloff then tries to stand, his killer starts to slit his throat.

The camera cuts out, then footage shows what appears to be Sotloff’s severed head placed on his body.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was in the middle of a daily briefing with reporters in DC when news surfaced about the new video, which lasted roughly 3 minutes.

Earnest said authorities were working to confirm its authenticity while adding, “Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff’s family.”

A man answering the phone at a Sotloff family home in Miami told The Post on Tuesday, “I can’t talk right now. I’m sorry,’’ before hanging up.

Sotloff — who freelanced for Time magazine as well as Foriegn Policy and the Christian Science Monitor — was abducted in Syria in August 2013.

He was last seen in the grisly video of Foley’s execution — when the terrorist killers threatened that he would be next.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” Foley’s ISIS killer hissed at the time.

Sotloff’s stricken mother, Shirley, pleaded from mercy from his captors in a heartbreaking video released last week.

“My son Steven is in your hands,” Shirley Sotloff said.

“Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,” she said. “He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.”",isi terrorist released video tuesday claim show beheading american journalist steven sotloff video titled second message america sotloff florida seen kneeling orange garb front black cloaked executioner following news footage president obama taking tough terror group sotloff say camera paying price u intervention syria stephen joel sotloff sure know exactly appearing time message say obama foreign policy intervention iraq supposed preservation american life interest pay price interference life american citizen spent billion u taxpayer dollar lost thousand troop previous fighting islamic state american interest reigniting war little know foreign policy remember time win election without promising bring troop back home iraq afghanistan close guantanamo sotloff say obama nearing end term achieved none deceivingly marching u american people blazing fire masked isi killer add british accent back obama back arrogant foreign policy towards islamic state missile continue strike people knife continue strike neck people unclear executioner fiend beheaded james wright foley video two week ago sotloff try stand killer start slit throat camera cut footage show appears sotloff severed head placed body white house press secretary josh earnest middle daily briefing reporter dc news surfaced new video lasted roughly minute earnest said authority working confirm authenticity adding thought prayer mr sotloff mr sotloff family man answering phone sotloff family home miami told post tuesday talk right sorry hanging sotloff freelanced time magazine well foriegn policy christian science monitor abducted syria august last seen grisly video foley execution terrorist killer threatened would next life american citizen obama depends next decision foley isi killer hissed time sotloff stricken mother shirley pleaded mercy captor heartbreaking video released last week son steven hand shirley sotloff said steven journalist traveled middle east cover suffering muslim hand tyrant steven loyal generous son brother grandson said honorable man always tried help weak,isi terrorist released video tuesday claim show beheading american journalist steven sotloff video titled second message america sotloff florida seen kneeling orange garb front black cloaked executioner following news footage president obama taking tough terror group sotloff say camera paying price u intervention syria stephen joel sotloff mr sotloff try stand killer start slit throat camera cut footage show appears

But after the video went viral, the furious teenager confronted Khoza in a pub, calling him a ‘dog’ before throwing battery acid over his lap.

1482,"A 19-YEAR-OLD woman woke up in the middle of brain surgery and was lucid enough to ask doctors how the surgery was going.

Iga Jasica, of Poland, was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice when, mid-surgery, the anaesthetic wore off, mirror.co.uk reported.

Jasica, whose brain was exposed at the time she awoke, asked the docs how the surgery was going — then started chatting about cats.

“Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said.

It’s possible the surgery may have triggered something that woke her up, experts said — but doctors are also looking into whether the anaesthesia was administered correctly.

Jasica later said: “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”

1486,"Earlier this year, Apple bought Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion. Since then, CEO Tim Cook has gone out of its way to rave about the Beats Music subscription service, which sells all-you-can-eat music for $10 a month.

So why would Apple plan to shut down Beats Music, as a TechCrunch headline reports?

Answer: It’s not.

Tom Neumayr, says the TechCrunch story is “not true”, but wouldn’t elaborate.

I can elaborate a bit more, based on conversations with people familiar with Apple’s thinking: Apple won’t shutter the streaming service. It may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand.

Note that Apple does seem pretty pleased with the iTunes brand, which was the focus of its controversial U2 album giveaway this month.

Shuttering the Beats Music brand name makes some sense, as the company hadn’t generated a ton of traction before Apple bought it in May — at that time, it only had a few hundred thousand subscribers. On the other hand, the Beats headphone brand, which Apple doesn’t have any plans to dump, has a lot of recognition, so it wouldn’t have seemed bizarre.",earlier year apple bought beat music beat electronics billion since ceo tim cook gone way rave beat music subscription service sell eat music month would apple plan shut beat music techcrunch headline report answer tom neumayr say techcrunch story true elaborate elaborate bit based conversation people familiar apple thinking apple shutter streaming service may however modify time one change could involved changing beat music brand note apple seem pretty pleased itunes brand focus controversial u album giveaway month shuttering beat music brand name make sense company generated ton traction apple bought may time hundred thousand subscriber hand beat headphone brand apple plan dump lot recognition seemed bizarre,apple bought beat music beat electronics billion since ceo tim cook gone way rave beat music subscription service sell music month would apple plan shut beat music techcrunch headline report answer tom neumayr say techcrunch story true elaborate elaborate bit based conversation people familiar apple thinking apple shutter streaming service may however modify time one change could involved changing beat music brand note apple seem pretty pleased itunes brand focus controversial u album giveaway month shuttering beat music brand name make sense company generated ton traction apple bought may time hundred thousand subscriber hand beat
1490,"Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob, but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.

""[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. “I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.""

There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil’s story. The first is the photographic “evidence” of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.

Second, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.

When asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn’t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.

The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil’s third breast is fake was the final result. “This technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,” he said. “Also, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.”

During a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a “striking” resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.

Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said “I beat women.” She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack, Buzzfeed wrote.

Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone else’s identification to get into a club. “I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol,” she wrote.

She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and “I really don’t care what people say about me.”

1493,"Leelah Alcorn, 17, had scheduled the letter to go live on her Tumblr account after her death

A transgender teenager who committed suicide left a heartbreaking note saying she could not ever see herself being happy.

Leelah Alcorn, 17, died in the early hours of Sunday morning when she walked out into a busy road on the I-71 highway in Ohio, USA.

She had scheduled the post to to go live on her Tumblr account before she died.

In the letter Leelah from Kings Mill, Ohio, wrote that although she was born a boy, she began identifying as a girl at the age of four.

The note begins: ""If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.”

Leelah also spoke about growing up with strict devout Christian parents who did not understand her and had not allowed her to transition when she turned 16.

""When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was.

""I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong,” said the letter.

Leelah Alcorn, who was born a boy, started identifying as a girl at the age of 4

It continued: ""I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me.

""I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out.""

At the end of the note Leelah pleaded that someone needed to look at the number of transgender people who committed suicide, and do something to “fix society”.

She signed it: ""Goodbye, (Leelah) Josh Alcorn”

Leelah's mother Carla Wood Alcorn posted a tribute to her child on her Facebook, but referred to Leelah as her 'son', used her birth name, and made no mention of a suicide.

Many in the LGBT community have been angered by the disregard for Leelah’s wishes to be identified as a girl, and a Facebook group calling for Justice for Leelah Alcorn has been set up.

1495,"BEIRUT — The ISIS terror group has published a video titled “A second message to America,” showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The video also threatens the life of British captive David Haines.

Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed, saying he is “paying the price” for U.S. intervention.

The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to President Barack Obama, telling him, “Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

Last week, Sotloff’s mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.

“Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,” she said. “He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.”

Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist, James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloff’s fate depended on what President Obama did next in Iraq.

Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public.

Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff’s release for the past year.

Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like “Lawrence of Arabia” and “The Big Lebowski” as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a “stand-up philosopher from Miami.”

In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area.

He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey — among other countries — and eventually Syria.

Sotloff’s killing likley will step up pressure on Obama to devise a strategy to combat ISIS.

On Friday, Obama said it’s too soon to discuss what steps the U.S. would take against the militant group inside Syria. On how to deal with the group in Syria — where it was born and has a safe haven, mostly in the city of Raqqa — the president said: “We don’t have a strategy yet.”

Obama said Friday that he has asked America’s top defense officials to prepare “a range of options.”",beirut isi terror group published video titled second message america showing beheading american journalist steven sotloff video also threatens life british captive david haines sotloff speaks camera killed saying paying price u intervention masked isi figure video speaks president barack obama telling missile continue strike people knife continue strike neck people last week sotloff mother shirley sotloff released video pleading isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi kill son steven journalist traveled middle east cover suffering muslim hand tyrant steven loyal generous son brother grandson said honorable man always tried help weak sotloff appeared last month isi video showing decapitation another american journalist james foley militant video warned sotloff fate depended president obama next iraq steven sotloff disappeared reporting syria august family kept news secret fearing harm went public public view family number government agency trying gain sotloff release past year sotloff grew south florida mother father younger sister majored journalism university central florida personal facebook page list musician like dave matthew band phish mile davis movie like lawrence arabia big lebowski favorite twitter page playfully identifies stand philosopher miami sotloff left ucf moved back miami area graduated another college began taking arabic class subsequently picked freelance writing work number publication including time foreign policy world affair christian science monitor travel took yemen saudi arabia qatar turkey among country eventually syria sotloff killing likley step pressure obama devise strategy combat isi friday obama said soon discus step u would take militant group inside syria deal group syria born safe mostly city raqqa president said strategy yet obama said friday asked america top defense official prepare range option,isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi kill son steven journalist traveled middle east cover suffering muslim hand tyrant steven loyal generous son brother grandson said honorable man always tried help weak sotloff appeared last month isi video showing decapitation another american journalist james foley militant video warned sotloff fate depended president obama next iraq steven sotloff disappeared reporting syria august family
1497,"The woman who became a poster girl of Kurdish resistance in the city of Kobane is actually alive, contrary to rumors spread by members of ISIS, who claimed to have beheaded her.

The woman, who went by the name Rehana, was seen as an image of hope in the city as it fought ISIS forces. An image of her giving the peace sign while dressed for battle went viral, making her an international symbol. Just two days ago, though, ISIS militants claimed to have captured Rehana and killed her by beheading. They sent photos of members holding her head high, alongside the ISIS flag.

Friends of Rehana have come forward to put an end to the rumors and state that Rehana made it out of Kobane and is living in southern Turkey, alive and well.

""She is my friend and I confirm that she is alive,"" an anonymous source told MailOnline. ""And the picture of [the] beheaded female fighter is not Rehana's picture. She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes, Rehana left Kobane.""

Right now, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are battling for control of the border town; Syrian Arab rebels have arrived in order to provide the Peshmerga with support. The U.S. has also provided air support, reportedly destroying five ISIS fighting positions and six vehicles. The Peshmerga and Syrian rebels apparently need further support, though it's unknown if they will be able to receive it in time to save the city of Kobane.

""The only way to help Kobane, since other countries don't want to use ground troops, is sending some peace-oriented or moderate troops to Kobane. What are they? Peshmerga … and Free Syrian Army,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the BBC.

Meanwhile, news of Rehana's safety has reached Syrian/Kurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader, who noted that she was ""fighting fiercely.""

Rehana, 28, told reporters that she wanted to join the forces because she ""lost many friends to this, and decided there was a need to join up.

1499,"The Islamic State (IS) has reportedly beheaded U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the second execution of an American journalist in the past two weeks.

Sotloff’s life was threatened in the same video released in August in which freelance journalist James Foley was behaded by an IS militant.

According to the New York Times, SITE Intelligence Group —a Jihadist threat-monitoring service —said Tuesday IS released a 2:46 min video showing Sotloff’s murder.


Global News has not seen the purported video, but is working to confirm details.

Sotloff’s mother, Shirley Sotloff, made a video plea last week asking IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to spare her son’s life.

“As a mother, I ask your justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad, who protected People of the Book. I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children’s children, I plead with you to grant me this.”

Sotloff, 31, disappeared in Syria in Aug. 2013, while covering the civil war in the country.

IS uploaded a video to YouTube on Aug. 19 showing the beheading of 40-year-old Foley, who had been held hostage since Nov. 2012.

The militant group demanded a $132-million ransom for Foley’s release, among other conditions.

Dornella Conners is now blind in her left eye and can hardly see out of her right eye after her and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, stopped at a gas station in the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday morning. Conners says as she and her boyfriend were driving away from the station multiple police officers showed up.
“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street, De’Anglas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back,” Conners said.
Conners says her boyfriend was trying to drive around St. Louis County Police but police say he drove towards them. Police say the officer, fearing for his safety, used his less lethal bean bag round, striking the front passenger window causing it to shatter.
Conner went to another police officer who helped her get medical attention.
“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of situation,” said Donnell Conners, Dornella’s father. “I understand tough job, I understand that it was chaos, there was no reason to fire upon innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”
Police say Lee drove away but he was not the only one causing trouble at the gas station. Sixteen people were arrested on the lot and police say they still do not know who is responsible for firing numerous gunshots at the location.

1505,"BOSTON (AP) - The three Afghanistan National Army officers who went missing during a training exercise at a Cape Cod military base have been found trying to cross the border into Canada, according to U.S. authorities. The three were found at Niagara Falls, N.Y. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick earlier said one of the possibilities being investigated is that they may be trying to find a way to stay in the United States.

Patrick said Monday that the military does not believe the three soldiers pose a danger to the public. ""I don't have a reason to believe that they pose a threat. They were vetted by the military, they were cleared by the military,"" Patrick told reporters while he visited a preschool program in Quincy. ""There is a lot of speculation within the military that they may be trying to defect,"" he said.

Lt. Col. James Sahady of the Massachusetts National Guard said there were no details to report on the search Monday. Military officials said the Afghan soldiers had been participating in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise at Joint Base Cape Cod. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen Saturday at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis during an off day for the program.

The soldiers were reported missing by base security personnel Saturday night. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

Xue was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile phone.

Instead of giving him the phone, the aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife, then came back and sliced off the boy's penis.

She fled the house before his mother could return.

1512,"It's Benghazi redux: As they secured the U.S. embassy in Yemen, the final Marines to leave the country handed their weapons over to Iran-friendly Houthi rebels, on orders from some Obama administration bureaucrat. That's the right-wing blogosphere's story, anyway, even though the Marine Corps calls it bullshit.

If this all sounds familiar, it's because a precedent has been set: Every time an overseas U.S. embassy is in extremis, the conservative-fantasy carousel kicks up a rumor about how our wonderful Marines could have handled everything, if only Barack Hussein Obama's State Department bureaucrats hadn't de-nutted them. When protests outside the Cairo embassy got ugly in 2012, conservatives floated a rumor that the U.S. ambassador had taken away the Marines' ammunition—on Obama's orders, of course—even though it's against standing military and diplomatic policy. The Marine Corps quickly dispelled that rumor.


Wingnuts Falsely Claim Obama Administration Forbade Marines From Carrying Live Ammo
The Marine Corps has confirmed to Mother Jones that a military blogger's popular conspiracy…
Read more motherjones.​com
This week's rumor was just as insane, if you weren't disposed to thinking of the current administration as evil incarnate. Enter the birther boobs of Newsmax:

Central Command reportedly is furious over a State Department order that Marines guarding the U.S. Embassy in Yemen were told by the State Department to turn their rifles over to Yemeni officials before boarding a private plane to evacuate the country, Fox News reports.

The order is humiliating to Marines, who are essentially being told to break an oath they take during training, Pete Hegseth, CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, told Fox News Channel's ""The Kelly File.""
The always meticulously accurate nativist bulletin board Breitbart.com also highlighted Kelly's Fox News report:

Now tonight a senior defense official confirming to Fox News that Marines were directed to turn over their weapons before they were allowed to leave. According to one source the order came from the U.S. State Department. That is generating some serious outrage tonight especially among Marines who are taught from day one never surrender your weapon. At least one Marine telling Fox News, 'Blank yeah, it pissed me off.' Pardon me, his term. 'I'm not giving up my weapon to anyone.'""
What really happened? Well, there clearly was a rushed egress from Yemen for the Marines, so much so that the Pentagon's press briefer, Col. Steve Warren, went out to talk to the media yesterday without really knowing what had happened:

The Pentagon said the Marines destroyed heavy weapons in their embassy arsenal, including machine guns, before leaving for the airport but remained armed with smaller weapons until the end to ensure a safe exit from the country.

""The movement from the embassy to the aircraft required armed Marines,"" Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said at a briefing...

Asked whether the Marines turned over their weapons to Houthi fighters, Warren said: ""It's unclear, frankly. We believe they turned them over to government officials at the airport, prior to boarding the aircraft.""

""As everyone knows, weapons are generally not authorized on commercial aircraft,"" Warren said. He said the Marines were probably carrying handguns and assault rifles until their departure.
Such is the stuff that crazy conspiracy theories are made of. Warren's shaky answers certainly made the fate of the Marines' weapons worth investigating. It's unclear who Fox News' unnamed sources were, but they were so compelling that Kelly and her hawkish guests were shrieking about their implications at 9 p.m. last night... three hours after the Marine Corps had debunked the whole cruddy rumor, twice.

First, they debunked it on background in a report by the independent Marine Corps Times just after 6 p.m.:

The Marine security detachment guarding the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen left no operational weapons behind as troops evacuated the country, a senior Marine official with knowledge of the movement told Marine Corps Times.

...the Marine official, who asked that he not be identified because he was unauthorized to discuss the situation, said no working Marine weapons, whether crew-served or personal rifles and sidearms, were seized or handed over as the troops departed.

""No Marines handed over a functional weapon to anybody,"" the official said.
Then, the Marines debunked it on the record, with minute details on how their weapons were scuttled so as to be useless, on their own website:


CLARITY ON MARINE SECURITY FORCE DEPARTURE FROM YEMEN

February / 11 / 2015

HEADQUARTERS MARINE CORPS, WASHINGTON — The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the ""ordered departure"" with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.

Upon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning. Specifically, each bolt was removed from its weapons body and rendered inoperable by smashing with sledgehammers. The weapons bodies, minus the bolts, were then separately smashed with sledgehammers. All of these destroyed components were left at the airport — and components were scattered; no usable weapon was taken from any Marine at Sana'a airport.

To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.

So how come Kelly was letting her Fox News guests hold forth on a debunked rumor, three hours later? ""We're surrendering our embassy,"" Hegseth told her. ""And now we're asking U.S. Marines to surrender their dignity, give up oaths they made, creeds that they lived by, and surrender their rifle."" Retired Gen. Jack Keane added: ""This is a mindless stupid bureaucrat making a decision like that offensive to military culture, offensive to procedures.""

It's probably helpful to know a little bit of background about those guests. Hegseth, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for Senate in Minnesota awhile back, is an ex-Bear Stearns banker whose way through Princeton was paid in part by the conservative Family Research Council. Since 2008, he's made six figures chairing astroturfed veterans' groups for GOP causes, and has been a seven-figure bag man for political donations from Republican billionaire Sheldon Adelson. He's on call whenever Republicans need a military vet to blast liberals, even though his own track record of strategic prognostications includes this gem: ""eliminating Saddam and liberating Iraq could be the 'Normandy Invasion' or 'fall of the Berlin Wall' of our generation… and there is equally encouraging evidence that republican principles could thrive there.""

Keane, for his part, cofounded and chaired a neoconservative propaganda front, the Institute for the Study of War, with some of Dick Cheney's top geopolitical advisors, using it to rally support for the "" troop surge"" in Iraq. Since leaving the service in 2003, he's been a paid consultant for military contractors, including the company formerly known as Blackwater. He's never met a costly military engagement he couldn't make costlier.

1514,"What began as an Occupy-inspired student sit-in exploded in Hong Kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators, using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. The Occupy Central protests spread from Hong Kong’s financial district to just outside the city’s government offices in Admiralty, but the law-enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect, sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city. The protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back, at least for now. Here’s what you need to know so far.

What started this?

After 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, but has operated semi-autonomously under what’s known as “one country, two systems,” outside of Beijing’s communist rule. The promise was that in 2017, Hong Kong would be allowed, for the first time, to elect its own leader (known as chief executive) in democratic elections, instead of having the slot filled by a committee from Beijing. But earlier this summer, China decided a committee was still necessary, and it would select the candidates for Hong Kong’s 2017 elections. Outrage has been building ever since.

Who’s out there?

The protests were organized in part by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, which has since called for an indefinite student strike, the New York Times reports. Young people are everywhere, but not alone. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union has joined them with a general strike, as have some professionals after the weekend violence — “office workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black T-shirts,” according to the Times.

Occupy Central with Love and Peace, meanwhile, is led by a University of Hong Kong law professor named Benny Tai, Businessweek reported earlier this summer. Tai has been organizing for months, and a look at his planning from June now serves as some serious foreshadowing:

At some point, Tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy Central, where most of Hong Kong’s top banks and other financial institutions (as well as Bloomberg) have their offices. Many companies are already taking no chances, developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work.

What do they want?

In addition to democratic elections in 2017 and continued autonomy for Hong Kong, as previously promised, protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive Leung Chun-ying. The economics are also less than ideal, and the country could be slipping into a recession.

How is the government reacting?

Not well, especially at first. Here’s a video from the ground of protesters being teargassed, in attacks that look familiar from Ferguson and helped stoke outrage among citizens:

The use of pepper spray has been equally alarming, and is reminiscent of previous Occupy protests in the U.S.

As Vox notes, some protesters have taken to using the “hands up, don’t shoot” imagery of the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson. It’s still a powerful image on the other side of the world:

.@attorneycrump Will you please show this to #MikeBrown's parents &let them know that he changed the WORLD! #HongKong pic.twitter.com/3u4FOSnp7x

Protesters in Ferguson have sent a message back:

It’s not surprising, then, that Beijing is blaming the West for stoking tensions. From the Times:

A commentary on the website of the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s main newspaper, claimed that the upheavals in Hong Kong were instigated by democratic radicals who had sought support from “anti-China forces” in Britain and the United States, and had sought lessons from independence activists in Taiwan. It called them a “gang of people whose hearts belong to colonial rule and who are besotted with ‘Western democracy’.”

Hong Kong has canceled its annual fireworks celebration of China’s National Day on Wednesday, indicating that this thing may continue for the foreseeable future.

“The protesters, they are so young,” a mother of two who joined the protests on Monday told the Times. “They are fighting for our future, for my children’s future.”",began occupy inspired student sit exploded hong kong weekend police responded excessive force toward peaceful demonstrator using tear gas pepper spray rubber bullet occupy central protest spread hong kong financial district outside city government office admiralty law enforcement crackdown opposite effect sending thousand street solidarity shutting portion city protest bled work week riot police pulled back least need know far started year british rule hong kong returned china operated semi autonomously known one country two system outside beijing communist rule promise hong kong would allowed first time elect leader known chief executive democratic election instead slot filled committee beijing earlier summer china decided committee still necessary would select candidate hong kong election outrage building ever since protest organized part hong kong federation student since called indefinite student strike new york time report young people everywhere alone hong kong professional teacher union joined general strike professional weekend violence office worker slack dress shirt mixed crowd student black shirt according time occupy central love peace meanwhile led university hong kong law professor named benny tai businessweek reported earlier summer tai organizing month look planning june serf serious foreshadowing point tai say movement may follow threat name occupy central hong kong top bank financial institution well bloomberg office many company already taking chance developing plan case demonstrator block street prevent employee getting work want addition democratic election continued autonomy hong kong previously promised protester demanding resignation current chief executive leung chun ying economics also le ideal country could slipping recession government reacting well especially first video ground protester teargassed attack look familiar ferguson helped stoke outrage among citizen use pepper spray equally alarming reminiscent previous occupy protest u hong kong police officer grab elderly protester turn pepper spray full face http co l pftggtf vox note protester taken using hand shoot imagery michael brown demonstration ferguson still powerful image side world attorneycrump please show mikebrown parent let know changed world hongkong pic twitter com u fosnp x protester ferguson sent message back heather ferguson protester wearing sign say stay strong hongkong pic twitter com cnqfferfl surprising beijing blaming west stoking tension time commentary website people daily chinese communist party main newspaper claimed upheaval hong kong instigated democratic radical sought support anti china force britain united state sought lesson independence activist taiwan called gang people whose heart belong colonial rule besotted western democracy hong kong canceled annual firework celebration china national day wednesday indicating thing may continue foreseeable future protester young mother two joined protest monday told time fighting future child future,hong kong weekend police responded excessive force toward peaceful demonstrator using tear gas pepper spray rubber bullet occupy central protest spread hong kong financial district outside city government office admiralty law enforcement crackdown opposite effect sending thousand street solidarity shutting portion city protest bled work week riot police pulled back least need know far started year british rule hong kong returned china operated semi autonomously known one country two system outside beijing communist rule promise hong kong would allow first time elect leader known chief executive democratic election
1516,"Saudi Arabia has announced that it has the right to cover women’s eyes—‘especially the tempting ones.’

“I love the looks of you, the lure of you

The sweet of you, and the pure of you

The eyes, the arms, and the mouth of you

The east, west, north, and the south of you”

—Cole Porter

It’s a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia’s religious police, isn’t a fan of Cole Porter. “The lure of you” is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women’s eyes that are deemed “tempting.” “The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones” he said. “[We] have the right to do so.”

What are “tempting” eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are “uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.” The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means “having an appeal.” What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is “arousing a sympathetic response.” And what is sympathetic? “Showing empathy,” according to Merriam-Webster.

So there you have it. To allow a women’s eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police—massively funded by King Abdullah—cannot do this. “It’s so stupid,” the Saudi journalist tells me. “I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

Perhaps they won’t be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: “The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.” No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.

How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.

If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it “tempting” to stop treating women as property.",saudi arabia announced right cover woman eye especially tempting one love look lure sweet pure eye arm mouth east west north south cole porter safe bet sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman saudi arabia religious police fan cole porter lure precisely nabet announced yesterday committee promotion virtue prevention vice cover woman eye deemed tempting men committee interfere force woman cover eye especially tempting one said right tempting eye one saudi journalist mused condition anonymity uncovered eye nice shape makeup even without makeup beautiful woman trouble orwellian named committee provide definition tempting happen rely merriam webster mean appeal appeal according dictionary arousing sympathetic response sympathetic showing empathy according merriam webster allow woman eye capture unfettered glory world one must empathize existence religious police massively funded king abdullah stupid saudi journalist tell know say stop many people oppose country silent perhaps committee promotion virtue prevention vice powerful backer country prince naif recently appointed heir throne said committee supported side supported pillar islam muslim support committee surprise king abdullah awarded draconian body additional million riyal million march america respond latest affront saudi woman perhaps sponsor contest tempting eye saudi arabia woman send picture tempting look winner get accompany president obama next meeting saudi dictator congress reconsidered recent billion u saudi arm deal religious police might quickly find tempting stop treating woman property,saudi arabia announced right cover woman eye especially tempting one love look lure sweet pure eye arm mouth east west north south cole porter safe bet sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman saudi arabia religious police fan cole porter lure precisely nabet announced yesterday committee promotion virtue prevention vice cover woman eye deemed tempting men committee interfere force woman cover eye especially tempting one said right tempting eye one saudi journalist mused condition anonymity uncovered eye nice shape makeup even without makeup beautiful woman trouble
1520,"Jabhat al-Nusra and Isis leaders are reportedly meeting to co-ordinate attacks

Isis fighters are reportedly just one mile away from Baghdad as reports emerge of al-Qaeda militants bolstering their ranks in Syria.

According to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, Isis was approaching the Iraqi capital on Monday morning.

""The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,"" a spokesperson said.

""They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little.""

Isis fighters were also battling Government forces in a key town 25 miles west of Baghdad - Amiriyat al-Fallujah.

According to a BBC correspondent, fighting had calmed by Monday afternoon but a standoff continued along the main road to nearby Fallujah, which is under Isis control.

The extremists had been advancing towards the capital but were held off by bombing and Iraqi ground forces.

US air strikes overnight targeted other Isis positions in Anbar province, the Pentagon said, and in Syria four more oil fields controlled by militants near Raqqa were hit on Sunday.

American officials called the attacks “successful” but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed mostly civilians were hit and a grain silo was destroyed.

The news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front.

The group is the Syrian offshoot of al-Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war.

Despite months of clashes between its forces and Isis (also known as Islamic State) militants, the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies.

Al-Nusra’s official spokesperson, Abu Firas al-Suri, threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday.

“These states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world,” he said.

“This is not a war against al-Nusra, but a war against Islam.”

Al-Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together, a source told the Guardian, although no formal alliance has been confirmed.

The reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis, which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an “Islamic State” straddling Iraq and Syria.

A loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al-Nusra in June in the town of Al-Bukamal near the Iraqi border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and the two groups have fought together against Government forces.

The report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al-Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin.

Although both Isis and al-Nusra are rooted in al-Qaeda, the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syria’s civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3,000 militants from both sides.

A merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2013, when Isis was known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), but the alliance was rejected by al-Nusra and overruled by al-Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri.

But the international response to Isis’ bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria, and the beheadings of British and American hostages, is pushing the groups towards an alliance.

An al-Nusra source told Reuters: “There are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State.”

A formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

A deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources, equipment stores and slow its advances.

The US has not said al-Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan, which some analysts suspect is part of al-Nusra.

The two groups have been known to co-operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al-Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Britain, the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al-Nusra as a terrorist group, citing its use of suicide bombing, terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law.

A small number of anti-Government groups, including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army, opposed the label after al-Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime.",jabhat al nusra isi leader reportedly meeting co ordinate attack isi fighter reportedly one mile away baghdad report emerge al qaeda militant bolstering rank syria according foundation relief reconciliation middle east isi approaching iraqi capital monday morning islamic state le km away entering baghdad spokesperson said said could never happen almost obama say overestimated iraqi army could well need short know little isi fighter also battling government force key town mile west baghdad amiriyat al fallujah according bbc correspondent fighting calmed monday afternoon standoff continued along main road nearby fallujah isi control extremist advancing towards capital held bombing iraqi ground force u air strike overnight targeted isi position anbar province pentagon said syria four oil field controlled militant near raqqa hit sunday american official called attack successful uk based syrian observatory human right claimed mostly civilian hit grain silo destroyed news come amid report emerging alliance isi force syria jabhat al nusra also known nusra front group syrian offshoot al qaeda fighting assad regime civil war despite month clash force isi also known islamic state militant two group appear forming loose coalition part country fight increasing attack u ally al nusra official spokesperson abu firas al suri threatened coalition nation retaliation saturday state committed horrible act going put list jihadist target throughout world said war al nusra war islam al nusra isi leader holding war planning meeting together source told guardian although formal alliance confirmed report follow growing defection islamist group isi seen better organised equipped create islamic state straddling iraq syria loyalty pledge reportedly made al nusra june town al bukamal near iraqi border syrian observatory human right said two group fought together government force report appeared confirmed twitter photograph showing egyptian al nusra front commander shaking hand isi leader chechen origin although isi al nusra rooted al qaeda two rival since isi started involvement syria civil war spring last year engaged bloody battle killing militant side merger declared isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi isi known al qaeda iraq aqi alliance rejected al nusra overruled al qaeda leader al zawahiri international response isi bloody rampage iraq syria beheading british american hostage pushing group towards alliance al nusra source told reuters hardline voice inside nusra pushing reconciliation islamic state formal alliance believed possible order al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri deal militant group would strengthen islamist force syria air strike cripple isi funding source equipment store slow advance u said al nusra targeted plane attacked new group called khorasan analyst suspect part al nusra two group known co operate khorasan believed made veteran al qaeda fighter battlefield experience mostly pakistan afghanistan britain u united nation among classed al nusra terrorist group citing use suicide bombing terrorist attack attempt impose islamic law small number anti government group including member secular free syrian army opposed label al nusra gained respect fighting assad regime,isi leader reportedly meeting co ordinate attack isi fighter reportedly one mile away baghdad report emerge al qaeda militant bolstering rank syria according foundation relief reconciliation middle east isi approaching iraqi capital monday . isi leader reportedly meeting co ordinate attack isi fighter reportedly one mile away baghdad report emerge al qaeda militant bolstering rank syria according foundation relief reconciliation middle east isi approaching
1525,"Late comedian's personal physician allegedly performed an unauthorized biopsy, causing a heart attack

Joan Rivers' personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while performing an unauthorized throat biopsy during the procedure that led to the comedian's death, according to CNN report on Tuesday.
A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia,"" an unnamed source close to the death investigation told the cable news network.

However, the clinic has denied previous media accounts of the spontaneous biopsy. ""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" a rep told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement on Sept. 12. Yorkville's medical director, Lawrence B. Cohen, has been forced out of his position on the board and is no longer performing procedures there. He also left his private-practice group, New York Gastroenterology Associates.

Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure when complications arose. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Rivers died on Sept. 4, at age 81. After an initial autopsy, the New York City medical examiner's office has said the cause of death is unclear and they need to run more tests.

1526,"A woman in Henan province has been arrested for reportedly chopping off her husband's penis after discovering that he was having an affair—then going to the hospital and cutting it off again.
The husband and father of five, 32-year-old Fan Lung, had used his wife's phone to send a steamy email to his mistress, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, from his home in the city of Shangqiu, The Mirror reports.
Fan had forgotten to log out of his account, and when his wife Feng, 30, looked through her phone, she found the message among several others that he'd sent to to his xiao san. In a fit of rage, Feng grabbed a pair of scissors and chopped off her husband's penis while he was sleeping in their bedroom.
Fan was taken to a hospital, where doctors were able to reattach his precious manhood. Feng, however, managed to sneak into his hospital room and cut his penis off again before tossing it out of a window, The Mirror said.
""The first [time] we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,"" a hospital spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.""
They brought the fighting couple back into the hospital and discovered that Feng had cut off her husband's newly reattached member.
Doctors and police searched outside for the man's severed penis, but to no avail. They believe it was carried off by a stray animal.
Fan, who'd lost a lot of blood at this point, is now in stable condition after undergoing emergency surgery but is ""extremely emotionally distraught,"" as one might expect.
Fan's side-lover, however, said she still plans to marry him.
""It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility, he has five children already,"" she was quoted as saying.

1527,"TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to shut down Beats Music, the streaming music service that it acquired earlier this year. The blog's Josh Constine says that he's confirmed the news with five sources at both Apple and Beats. And to be honest, it makes sense.

It seems very unlikely that Apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether. If true, news that Beats Music is dying reads as a clear indication that Apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand iTunes Radio. Constine agrees:

Considering Apple's penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music's CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning he's already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music.

Based on images of the home screen, Constine adds, it looks like Apple's readying a new music app just for the new Apple Watch. People thought the company's music app for wearables would be Beats Music. And maybe it sort of is on the back end! It just won't be called Beats Music.

1536,"Hewlett-Packard confirmed on Monday that it will split the company into two new corporations, one focused on PCs and printers and the other on its enterprise businesses.

News of the split was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. On Monday, HP disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it would proceed with the plan, which is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year 2015.

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” said HP chief executive Meg Whitman said in a press release. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan.”

HP’s split arrives less than a week after eBay’s decision to spin-off PayPal into a separate, public company.

1546,"The crabs human see or eat are usually only six or so inches across their shells. An aerial image taken in the UK captured a massive crab, and is now garnering a lot of attention online. The aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs. It's estimated that the beast measures 50 feet long.

Quinton Winter, who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual, is one of the folks who has seen the picture. Initially, he believed he was looking at a bizarre sand formation that bore a striking resemblance to a crab. However, he now thinks it is indeed a real-life crab -- one that he actually saw in person last summer. Winter explained, 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'That's a funny looking bit of driftwood.'

1550,"Dave Morin's social networking company Path is reportedly in Apple Inc.'s acquisition path.

Apple Inc. is close to buying social network Path as it aims to bolster its social media efforts, PandoDaily reported, citing an internal source on Apple's engineering team.

The purchase would be more than an acquihire, the process when a company buys a company for its talent rather than its product. Path's platform will probably survive the acquisition and somehow be incorporated into Apple's revamped Messages app, according to the article. It isn't clear how big the price tag will be, but Path's 25 million users probably wouldn't command a sum that nears Facebook Inc.'s $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp, which boasts more than 400 million users.

Co-founder and CEO Dave Morin declined to comment one way or another onstage at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference on Wednesday.

San Francisco-based Path, a personal mobile photo-sharing and message platform, has raised a total of $77 million from backers including First Round, Index Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Insight Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Greylock Partners. It most recently nabbed $25 million in January.

1552,"HP is set to cleave itself in two, splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal, an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. ""Sources familiar with the matter"" tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation, and will remain CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high-ranking executive in the division.

This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the company's very tumultuous 2011, reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella.

The company, based in Palo Alto, has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The company's printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation, though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year, HP lost the title of top-selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo.",hp set cleave two splitting pc printer division enterprise service business according wall street journal announcement could come soon tomorrow source familiar matter tell paper current ceo meg whitman become chairman pc printer operation remain ceo split enterprise business dion weisler become ceo personal computing business currently high ranking executive division first time talk splitting hp surfaced company tumultuous report suggested executive close making decision split enterprise division business departure ceo l apotheker company decided keep unit together corporate umbrella company based palo alto struggled along rest pc industry profit margin slimmed sale window pc continue steadily decline company printer business lucrative pc operation though two combined unit back year hp lost title top selling pc manufacturer lenovo,hp set cleave two splitting pc printer division enterprise service business according wall street journal announcement could come soon tomorrow source familiar matter tell paper current ceo meg whitman become chairman pc printer operation remain ceo split enterprise business dion weisler become ceo personal computing business currently high ranking executive division first time talk splitting hp surfaced company tumultuous report suggested executive close making decision split enterprise division business departure ceo l apotheker company decided keep unit together corporate umbrella
1553,"Rest in purrs.

A Florida feline has been dubbed a “zombie cat” after clawing his way out of an untimely grave. The cat's owner, Tampa resident Ellis Hutson, 52, told ABC News he found his pet, Bart, in the road a couple of weeks ago.

Bart, who seemed to have been hit by a car, was in a pool of blood and Hutson says he was sure the cat was dead.

Because he and the animal were “so close,” he says he couldn’t bear to bury the cat himself. He enlisted the help of his neighbor and watched him put Bart to rest … or so he thought.

Days later, a bedraggled Bart -- who had apparently dug himself out of the ground --  made his way to another neighbor’s yard, Fox 13 reports.

""I open the door and my neighbor's standing there with the cat in her hand,"" Hutson told ABC. ""She said, 'Bart is not dead.' I said, 'That’s impossible. We buried Bart.'""

Hutson rushed the cat to the hospital, where Bart was treated for injuries including severe head trauma, a broken jaw and a dead eye.

Veterinarians at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay expect Bart to fully recover and be able to return home, although he will lose one of his eyes.

1557,"It may be 2015, but one airline reportedly has plans to gender separate their passengers completely. Due to religious and modesty regulations, the airline plans to “enforce” separation, according to a spokesman for the company.

The airline in question is Saudi Arabia’s national airline, Saudia as reported on the RT website. Saudia wants to separate male and female air travellers, mainly due to complaints from husbands who don’t like unknown men sitting next to their wives.

Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told reporters, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

As such, the airline hopes to begin arranging for check-in staff at the airport to assign separate seating for their passengers, unless they are closely related.

As widely reported, it isn’t just Muslims who have these modesty issues as Orthodox Jews also have similar laws calling for the separation of men and women in public.

Back in September, an El AL flight from New York to Israel’s Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport was delayed because some orthodox male flyers refused to sit next to women.

But while these religious practices are all fine for some people, they are not suitable for others, and certainly not on a public place like an airplane, where flight crews are constantly working against the clock to ensure their aircraft takes off on time.

It terms of the FAA’s rules for this type of crew disruption, Federal Aviation Regulations 91.11, 121.580 and 135.120 state that “no person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmember’s duties aboard an aircraft being operated.”

It therefore remains to be seen what course of action will be taken by Saudia airlines, and if plans to separate people based on gender is even legal, not to mention the logistical and ethical nightmare.",may one airline reportedly plan gender separate passenger completely due religious modesty regulation airline plan enforce separation according spokesman company airline question saudi arabia national airline saudia reported rt website saudia want separate male female air traveller mainly due complaint husband like unknown men sitting next wife saudia assistant manager marketing abdul rahman al fahd told reporter solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger airline hope begin arranging check staff airport assign separate seating passenger unless closely related widely reported muslim modesty issue orthodox jew also similar law calling separation men woman public back september el al flight new york israel tel aviv ben gurion airport delayed orthodox male flyer refused sit next woman religious practice fine people suitable others certainly public place like airplane flight crew constantly working clock ensure aircraft take time term faa rule type crew disruption federal aviation regulation state person may assault threaten intimidate interfere crewmember performance crewmember duty aboard aircraft operated therefore remains seen course action taken saudia airline plan separate people based gender even legal mention logistical ethical nightmare,airline plan gender separate passenger completely due religious modesty regulation airline plan enforce separation according spokesman company airline question saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national airline saudi arabia national
1558,"If there’s one thing Apple currently lacks, it’s a good social layer to their various offerings. Perhaps to satiate our need to be digitally social, Apple is reportedly close to purchasing the nearly four-year-old Path. Insiders say the deal may already be done, too.

According to Pando Daily, one well-placed source on Apple’s Engineering squad says “It’s almost done, if not signed already, but it’s essentially a done deal.” So why is Apple interested in Path, if they indeed are? In a way, they’re kindred.

Path struggles to find users, but that’s obviously not why they and Apple are so similar. If anything positive can be said of Path, it’s with their design. They’ve been widely lauded as a heavy-hitter when it comes to UI and experience, something Apple covets in their own right.
Further evidence of this comes with news that Dave Morin — current Path CEO and former Apple employee — was spotted sitting front and center at Apple’s iPhone 6/Apple Watch event yesterday. That’s a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners, not the CEO if a hit-and-miss social platform Apple has no involvement in.

Apple snapping up Path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like Morin back in the fold. Pando’s source says Path will survive the acquisition whole, and be cobbled (somehow, maybe lightly) into Apple’s revamped Messaging app.

It seems a likely acquisition, and it will be interesting to see how Apple works Path into their fold. Path is good, but suffers the same “ghost town” moniker that haunts other social platforms like Google+. But hey, at least it will probably work out better than Apple’s previous social experiment, right?

Right?

1561,"Saudi Arabia's national airline is allegedly planning to separate male and female passengers on its flights, in accordance to strict rules enforced by the Gulf kingdom.

Gulf media report that Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives.

The move follows a spate of complaints from male fliers unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members.

National carrrier Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives

Complaints were also recently made when male passengers claimed a flight attendant was being too 'flirty'.

'There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,' Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, told Saudi daily, Ajel.

It is thought that the airline will include instructions to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place.

The carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served onboard, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area.

In addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.

But moves are being made to employ females on the ground in November, the airline opened its fourth women's section staffed by entirely by females at its office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh.

There are no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board.

The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home.

In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors.

Women who are seen socialising with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

The majority of Gulf operated airlines abide by Islamic laws, but vary over strictness.

For example United Emirates carrier, Etihad's new A380 aircraft includes a prayer area in Business class, but the new cabin crew uniform, launched last month, does not feature a veil.

Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Baumgartner, told MailOnline Travel: ‘Modern Arabia is what is going on in Abu Dhabi, we are inspired by what’s going on in the rest of the world, but through the lens of the local DNA.

1566,"FERGUSON, Mo. (CBS St. Louis/AP) — A pregnant woman lost her eye during protests in Ferguson early Tuesday morning after a St. Louis County Police officer fired a bean bag round at the car she was in, shattering the glass on the passenger-side window.
Dornella Conner told KMOV-TV that she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were at a gas station early Tuesday morning during the protests following a grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown. Conners claims that they were trying to drive around the officers’ cars, but they blocked them in.
“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street. De’Angelas was trying to get away. They blocked us from the side, front and back,” Conners told KMOV.
Police, though, tell the station that Lee was driving his car toward them and that’s when an officer fired a bean bag round at the car, which shattered the passenger-side glass where Conner was sitting.
“I didn’t have any weapons. I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend and we were just riding around and respecting Mike Brown,” Conners said.
Conner sought medical attention from another police officer before she was taken to a hospital. The shattered glass left her blind in her left eye.
“I’m very upset and very disappointed with tactics that they used on trying to get control of the situation that was going,” Donnell Conner, Dornella’s father, told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person that’s sitting in a vehicle.
“How can a pregnant person in a car in a seatbelt be causing chaos?”
Dornella Conner took to Facebook to thank her family and friends for their support.
“[I’m] blind in my left eye and they took it out because I got shot in my face so I can only see in my right eye, but thank God that i can see the world and still alive,” she wrote. “I’m in a lot of pain but I’m ok.”
KMOV reports that an arrest warrant has been issued for Lee and a bond has been set at $50,000. Sixteen people were arrested on the gas station lot located on the 10000 block of Halls Ferry Road on Tuesday.
Despite the violence this week, protesters in Ferguson pressed pause Thursday as the city welcomed Thanksgiving, decorating boarded-up storefronts with some Dr. Seuss inspiration and gathering for church services — a stark contrast to previous days of outrage over the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown case.
No police officers or Missouri National Guard members stood sentry outside the Ferguson police station, which has been a nexus for protesters since Monday night’s announcement,
On that downtown street, beneath a lighted “Season’s Greetings” garland, three children used paintbrushes to decorate the plywood covering many storefront windows that was put up to foil potential vandals. One quoted from “The Lorax” by Dr. Seuss: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it’s not.”
“We thought we’d do what we could to make it a little more attractive and then try to bring the kids into it and get them involved in making the businesses appear a little less scary, depressing,” said Leah Bailey, as her 7-year-old son Dennis climbed a ladder to finish an orange dragon.
Several hours after dark, a few people continued painting, but there was no visible protest activity. National Guard troops occasionally patrolled the area and surrounding neighborhoods in vehicles and on foot.
Since the grand jury’s decision, protests have taken place across the country. Most have been peaceful. But at least 130 demonstrators who refused to disperse during a Los Angeles protest were arrested Wednesday night, while 35 people were detained in Oakland following a march that deteriorated into unrest and vandalism, according to police officials.
Back in Ferguson, Greater St. Mark Family Church sits blocks from where several stores went up in flames after the grand jury announcement. A handful of people listened to the Rev. Tommie Pierson preach Thursday that the destruction and chaos was by “a small group of out-of-control people out there.”
“They don’t represent the community, they don’t represent the mood nor the feelings of the community,” Pierson said. “I would imagine if you talked to them, they probably don’t even live here. So, we don’t want to be defined by what they did.”
In downtown St. Louis, a group gathered near Busch Stadium for what organizer Paul Byrd called a “pro-community” car rally meant to be peaceful and counter the recent Ferguson violence he suggested has tarnished the region’s image.
Byrd, a 45-year-old construction worker from Imperial, Missouri, declined to say whether he supported Wilson but noted, “I totally support police officers.” The cruise was escorted by a city police vehicle; no protesters showed up.

On prematurely waking from anaesthesia, she was apparently neither panicky or in agony but rather calmly inquired after the progress of the operation.

An investigation has begun into the incident but the hospital have insisted that the patient suffered no undue pain despite regaining consciousness mid-surgery.

Miss Jasica allegedly told reporters: ‘I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

‘I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.’

1587,"Apparently Lenovo is still interested in BlackBerry.

China's Lenovo could make an offer to acquire the Canadian smartphone maker as early as this week, ""a source familiar with the matter"" told Benzinga.

Lenovo expressed interest in buying the Waterloo-based tech titan last year, but the Canadian government told the Beijing-based computer manufacturer it would not allow a Chinese takeover, citing national security concerns.

This time could be different, however, because Lenovo announced the creation of a new company focused on the internet of things, a space which BlackBerry has shown emerging interest in. That new company, slated to launch next year, would operate under a separate name and brand.

1591,"The Beats Music brand could be singing its last tune.

According to a report published by TechCrunch, Apple has begun to wind down the streaming music service that it acquired in May, with many of its staffers already moved onto other projects at Apple. ITunes is said to be one of them.

Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers already has been put in charge of iTunes Radio, with the Beats Music technology likely to be integrated into that service, sources say.

Beats Music has not been heavily promoted during Apple’s recent product demonstrations, including the launch of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as its Apple Watch.

In fact, the new smartphones do not include Beats Music pre-loaded as an app — an unusual move and sign that Apple has other plans for Beats Music’ technology. U2’s free album was offered through Beats Music.

While the Apple Watch, out next year, will include a music app, Beats Music wasn’t mentioned during its launch demo.

The confusion two separate music services could generate among consumers is said to be one of the reasons Apple is making the move to close Beats Music. Apple also had shut down another streaming service, Lala, after acquiring it.

While Apple isn’t expected to entirely do away with Beats Music, the company is rethinking whether to still operate it as a separate brand, sources also confirmed to Re/Code.

While Beats Music has the Beats headphone brand helping put it in the spotlight, the service has struggled to compete against more established online players like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and Google Music.

It had just 111,000 paying subscribers in March, and 250,000 in May, according to Jimmy Iovine. That’s compared to 10 million for Spotify.

Beats Music was part of the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics Apple made in August.

Apple and Beats have not commented on the potential shuttering of the service.

1593,"“Jihadi John,” the Briton believed to have beheaded the American ISIS hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff, may have been injured in U.S.-led airstrikes last week, the British government said Saturday. The comments came amid a Daily Mail report that claimed Jihadi John was taken to an Iraqi hospital after he was injured in a bombing targeting a meeting of Islamic State leaders on the Iraq-Syria border.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman told Reuters, adding the office was looking into the possibility Jihadi John was injured. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

Jihadi John, also known as Jalman al-Britani, was at a meeting in an underground bunker attended by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi that was targeted in U.S.-led airstrikes last week, the Daily Mail reported. About 40 militants were injured in the strike last Saturday, and Jihadi John was taken to a hospital in al-Qaim, Iraq, before being transported to the Islamic State group’s headquarters in Raqqa, Syria. Baghdadi was also reported wounded in the attack.

The British Foreign Office told the Daily Mail it is investigating the accuracy of the reports, but is hampered by a lack of presence in Syria where ISIS controls a large swath of territory.

“The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days,” a spokesman said. “We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.”

Jihadi John was the name given by the media to the masked figure who had a British accent and appeared in the beheading videos of Foley, Sotloff and the British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning. In the Foley and Sotloff videos, the knife-wielding terrorist issues a “message to America” to abandon the airstrikes aimed at ISIS.",jihadi john briton believed beheaded american isi hostage james foley steven sotloff may injured u led airstrikes last week british government said saturday comment came amid daily mail report claimed jihadi john taken iraqi hospital injured bombing targeting meeting islamic state leader iraq syria border aware report british foreign office spokeswoman told reuters adding office looking possibility jihadi john injured confirm report jihadi john also known jalman al britani meeting underground bunker attended isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi targeted u led airstrikes last week daily mail reported militant injured strike last saturday jihadi john taken hospital al qaim iraq transported islamic state group headquarters raqqa syria baghdadi also reported wounded attack british foreign office told daily mail investigating accuracy report hampered lack presence syria isi control large swath territory incident occurred last weekend received report last day spokesman said representation inside syria difficult confirm report jihadi john name given medium masked figure british accent appeared beheading video foley sotloff british hostage david haines alan henning foley sotloff video knife wielding terrorist issue message america abandon airstrikes aimed isi,believed beheaded american isi hostage james foley steven sotloff may injured u led airstrikes last week british government said saturday comment came amid daily mail report claimed jihadi john briton believed beheaded american isi hostage james foley steven sotloff may injured u led airstrikes last week british government said saturday comment came amid daily mail report claimed jihadi john taken
1596,"Reports Monday said that Islamist fighters for ISIS, the Islamic State, which has already conquered large areas of Lebanon and Iraq, are at the gates of Baghdad. Despite the aerial attacks being carried out by the US and its allies, the group's fighters have been steadily progressing, and are said to be barely a mile from the city. The report in the Independent newspaper, published in London, quoted officials of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East.

According to the officials, Islamic State terrorists could basically enter the city at will, as there is little substantial defense to prevent them from doing so. ""The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,"" the spokesperson said. “They said it could never happen and now it almost has. [US President Barack] Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do,"" the report quoted the spokesperson as saying.

Obama indeed made that admission Sunday night, in an interview broadcast on CBS news program 60 Minutes. “Over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swathes of the country that are completely ungoverned,"" the president said, Islamic State was ""able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos.

""This became ground zero for jihadists around the world,"" Obama said of Syria, where Islamic State now controls territory in the east around on the city of Raqqa. “Where you've got states that are failing or in the midst of civil war, these kinds of organizations thrive,"" he said.

In a separate development over the weekend, the head of the Syrian Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front said that it would work with Islamic State to defeat the “Western infidels,” reports said. ""Muslims will not watch while their sons are bombed. Your leaders will not be the only ones who would pay the price of the war. You will pay the heaviest price,"" he said, warning that the battle would be brought ""to the hearts of your homes,” said Al-Nusra head Abu Mohamad al-Golani. ""You should protect yourselves from this war by standing against the decisions of your rulers and stop them from bringing you the woes (of war),"" he added, according to Reuters.

""We are in a long war. This war will not end in months nor years. This war could last for decades,"" group spokesman Abu Firas al-Suri said.

""It's not a war against Nusra Front, it's a war against Islam,” he added.

IS and the Al-Nusra Front share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but they fell out during a power struggle and have been battling each other this past year.

Nusra Front is now coming under pressure from its own members to reconcile with Islamic State and join forces to fight what they describe as a ""crusader"" campaign against Islam.

Al-Nusra Front, whose leader pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri, has been heavily involved in the fighting in Syria as well as in neighboring Lebanon, where it has claimed responsibility for several bombings and has also threatened local Sunnis.

Most recently, members of the group kidnapped 45 Fijian UN peacekeepers and threatened to try them under Islamic law before ultimately releasing them.",report monday said islamist fighter isi islamic state already conquered large area lebanon iraq gate baghdad despite aerial attack carried u ally group fighter steadily progressing said barely mile city report independent newspaper published london quoted official foundation relief reconciliation middle east according official islamic state terrorist could basically enter city little substantial defense prevent islamic state le km away entering baghdad spokesperson said said could never happen almost u president barack obama say overestimated iraqi army could report quoted spokesperson saying obama indeed made admission sunday night interview broadcast cbs news program minute past couple year chaos syrian civil war essentially huge swathe country completely ungoverned president said islamic state able reconstitute take advantage chaos became ground zero jihadist around world obama said syria islamic state control territory east around city raqqa got state failing midst civil war kind organization thrive said separate development weekend head syrian al qaeda linked al nusra front said would work islamic state defeat western infidel report said muslim watch son bombed leader one would pay price war pay heaviest price said warning battle would brought heart home said al nusra head abu mohamad al golani protect war standing decision ruler stop bringing woe war added according reuters long war war end month year war could last decade group spokesman abu firas al suri said war nusra front war islam added al nusra front share ideology rigid islamic belief fell power struggle battling past year nusra front coming pressure member reconcile islamic state join force fight describe crusader campaign islam al nusra front whose leader pledged allegiance al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri heavily involved fighting syria well neighboring lebanon claimed responsibility several bombing also threatened local sunni recently member group kidnapped fijian un peacekeeper threatened try islamic law ultimately releasing,isi islamic state already conquered large area lebanon iraq gate baghdad despite aerial attack carried u ally group fighter steadily progressing said barely mile city report independent newspaper published london quoted official foundation relief reconciliation middle east . could never happen almost u president barack obama say overestimated iraqi army could report quoted spokesperson said could never happen almost u president barack obama say overestimated i

1601,"A Polish teenager allegedly woke up during a surgical operation on her brain and asked the doctors a simple question: How is the surgery going?

Iga Jasica, 19, was receiving treatment at Central Clinical Hospital in Katowice, Poland, for a cancerous growth on her brain. According to the Mirror, Jasica awoke during the surgery after the anesthetic she had been administered wore off.

Jasica’s brain was exposed as she verbally communicated with the doctors, asking them how the surgery was going. Her tone was apparently casual, and she wasn’t disturbed by waking up during the procedure.

“Despite coming round she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” said Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz, who explained that the girl couldn’t see or feel anything during the operation.

Jasica remained optimistic about her experience in the operating room, mostly acknowledging her gratitude that the surgery was successful.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great,” Jasica said.

According to Fox News, doctors at the hospital are investigating whether or not the anesthetic was improperly administered prior to Jessica’s operation.

1604,"Here's a sentence you probably never thought you'd read: Mittens, a hermaphroditic cat from Newfoundland, is getting gender assignment surgery. Colleen Clarke-Murphy's daughter brought the stray cat home, and when the family took it to the vet, they were told it has both male and female genitalia, CBC reports.

Mittens' dual gender has caused the cat to have bowel and urinary troubles. The solution: Spay and neuter the cat, then assign a gender (the vet recommends male) and give it reconstructive surgery.

The cost: $1,500, which a friend is helping the family raise. Clarke-Murphy says it's worth it, because Mittens has been ""part of my family"" since October.

As Bustle and Cosmopolitan point out, while hermaphroditic cats are rare, gender-related operations in cats aren't as uncommon as you might imagine. Last year, Mother Nature Network reported that some male cats suffering from urinary problems get what's called a ""perineal urethrostomy,"" in which its male genitals are removed and the urethra's opening is shortened to create an opening similar to what a female cat would have.

Of course, the purpose of such procedures isn't to reassign gender but to ease health problems, but that doesn't stop some from seeing it as a sex change.

And as for a fellow hermaphrodite, last year a Liverpool cat with both male and female parts had surgery to become female. (Speaking of expensive and strange veterinary procedures, here are two stories about goldfish surgeries.)

1607,"Johannesburg - Children are being forced to imitate real dog fights, with bets placed on which child would cause the most injuries through biting and scratching, The Star reported on Monday.

A school in Springs, Ekurhuleni requested the help of Inspector Wendy Wilson from the National Council of SPCAs in June, according to the report.

The school's principal, who was not named to protect the identity of the children, was concerned that pupils returned from break time with torn clothing and injuries, Wilson told the newspaper.

Teachers discovered that the children fought each other in dog-fighting role-play, while other pupils placed bets on who would win.

The children were doing this reportedly because adults encouraged them during weekends to take part in actual dog-fighting as well as role-playing.

""They rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury,"" Wilson was quoted as saying.

Other children placed bets of between R2 and R10.

""The winner of the fight then gets to mate with a younger child as reward,"" Wilson told the newspaper.

She was not sure whether this role-playing moved on to actual copulation.

The Gauteng education department said it was made aware of the allegations early last year.

""The department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention,"" spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane was quoted as saying.",johannesburg child forced imitate real dog fight bet placed child would cause injury biting scratching star reported monday school spring ekurhuleni requested help inspector wendy wilson national council spcas june according report school principal named protect identity child concerned pupil returned break time torn clothing injury wilson told newspaper teacher discovered child fought dog fighting role play pupil placed bet would win child reportedly adult encouraged weekend take part actual dog fighting well role playing rip play aggressive enough cause injury wilson quoted saying child placed bet r r winner fight get mate younger child reward wilson told newspaper sure whether role playing moved actual copulation gauteng education department said made aware allegation early last year department contacted spca request intervention spokesperson phumla sekhonyane quoted saying,johannesburg child forced imitate real dog fight bet placed child would cause injury biting scratching star reported monday school spring ekurhuleni requested help inspector wendy wilson national council spcas june according report school principal named protect identity child concerned pupil returned break time torn clothing injury wilson told newspaper teacher discovered child fought dog fighting role play pupil placed bet would win child reportedly adult encouraged weekend take part actual dog fighting well role playing rip play aggressive
1609,"Iraqi officials said Sunday that the head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was wounded in an airstrike in western Anbar province. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured.

Iraq's Defence and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night.

The reports came at a time when U.S. President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the ISIS militants.

Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force.

He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

U.S. also targeted ISIS leaders in weekend strikes

The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.

A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defence Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defence official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.

Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.

The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armoured vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.

When asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: ""We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.""

Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.

""They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,"" Abdurrahman said.

There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.

'They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital.'
- Rami Abdurrahman, director of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.

Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.

Obama OKs more ground troops in Iraq

On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.

The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.

Kurdish Peshmerga fighters shoot toward Baretle village, which is controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), on the edge of Mosul, Iraq, on Sept. 8. Iraqi soldiers, joined by militia groups and backed by U.S. airstrikes, are fighting to keep the Sunni jihadist group from continuing its violent expansion across the region.

Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.

In an interview with CBS' Face the Nation that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.

""Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offence,"" Obama said.

""The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" he added.",iraqi official said sunday head islamic state iraq syria isi abu

1612,"An Afghan mother claims to have killed 25 Taliban militants and injured several others after she found her son, who was a police, dead in a fierce gun battle with the insurgents at his check post in western Farah province.

""Reza Gul"" the Afghan mother who rushed to take revenge of her son's death stood behind an armament and claimed the lives of 25 insurgents.

Woken up by the gunfire, Reza Gul told TOLOnews that she had no other option but to pick up a weapon after she found her son, who was the in charge of an outpost, dead in front of her eyes.

""It was around 5 a.m. when my son's check post came under the attack of Taliban,"" Gul said. ""When the fighting intensified, I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon, went to the check post and began shooting back.""

Few minutes later, Gul was not alone when she found her husband, daughter, youngest son and daughter-in-law holding weapons and accompanying her in the fight against the insurgents.

""The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons,"" said Seema, Gul's daughter-in-law. ""We were committed to fight until the last bullet.""
The fighting lasted several hours with 25 insurgents dead and many others wounded, she added.

""We started a kind of family war against the Taliban,"" Fatima, daughter of Gul said, adding that she was personally preparing bullets for her father and mother to fight off the enemies.
Gul's husband Abdul Satar stated they were ready to sacrifice the entire family, but not allow the Taliban to get closer to the check post.

""My young son who was a police officer was killed in front of my eyes,"" Abdul Satar said. ""I pulled aside his dead body and started fighting to defend my soil to prove that this is the soil of Malalay, the hero. I was committed to give up my life, but not my son's check post.""

1616,"When a South Korean woman invested in a robot vacuum cleaner, the idea was to leave her trustworthy gadget to do its work while she took a break from household chores.

Instead, the 52-year-old resident of Changwon city ended up being the victim of what many believe is a peek into a dystopian future in which supposedly benign robots turn against their human masters.

The woman, whose name is being withheld, was taking a nap on the floor at home when the vacuum cleaner locked on to her hair and sucked it up, apparently mistaking it for dust.

The agony of having her hair entangled in the bowels of the contraption roused the woman from her slumber.

Unable to free herself, she called the fire department with a “desperate rescue plea” and was separated from the robot’s clutches by paramedics, according to the South Korean newspaper the Kyunghyang Shinmun.

She escaped serious injury, although it is not known whether she has retained the autonomous cleaner’s services.

Robot vacuum cleaners have grown in popularity in recent years, with US firm iRobot’s circular Roomba selling well over 10 million units in the 12 years since its debut in 2002.

Panasonic recently unveiled Rulo, a triangular rival to Roomba that the Japanese firm says is more adept at sucking up dust from corners.

The wheeled gadgets are equipped with sensors that enable them to steer clear of obstacles, avoid tumbling down stairs, and detect dust and other debris on the floor. They can also be programmed to seek out a recharging dock.

Korean Biz Wire pointed out, however, that people from cultures in which it’s commonplace to sit or nap on the floor - such as Japan and South Korea – may be more vulnerable to vacuum robot rage.",south korean woman invested robot vacuum cleaner idea leave trustworthy gadget work took break household chore instead year old resident changwon city ended victim many believe peek dystopian future supposedly benign robot turn human master woman whose name withheld taking nap floor home vacuum cleaner locked hair sucked apparently mistaking dust agony hair entangled bowel contraption roused woman slumber unable free called fire department desperate rescue plea separated robot clutch paramedic according south korean newspaper kyunghyang shinmun escaped serious injury although known whether retained autonomous cleaner service robot vacuum cleaner grown popularity recent year u firm irobot circular roomba selling well million unit year since debut panasonic recently unveiled rulo triangular rival roomba japanese firm say adept sucking dust corner wheeled gadget equipped sensor enable steer clear obstacle avoid tumbling stair detect dust debris floor also programmed seek recharging dock korean biz wire pointed however people culture commonplace sit nap floor japan south korea may vulnerable vacuum robot rage,woman invested robot vacuum cleaner idea leave trustworthy gadget work took break household chore instead year old resident changwon city ended victim many believe peek dystopian future supposedly benign robot turn human master woman whose name withheld taking nap floor home vacuum cleaner locked hair sucked apparently mistaking dust agony hair entangled bowel contraption roused woman unable free called fire department desperate rescue plea separated robot clutch paramedic according south korean newspaper kyunghyang shinmun escaped
1617,The woman who claimed she had a third breast has been proved a hoax.,woman claimed third breast proved hoax,Frau claimed third breast proved hoax
1618,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

1620,"Officials in Baghdad and Washington remained unclear on Sunday about the fate of the Islamic State (Isis) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after a key aide was killed in a US air strike near Mosul.

A senior Iraqi official confirmed to the Guardian that the aide, Abdur Rahman al-Athaee, also known as Abu Sajar, was killed in the the attack late on Friday night, which hit a 10-car convoy southwest of the Isis stronghold.

Athaee was known to have been in almost constant contact with Baghdadi and officials deduced that his presence in the convoy likely meant that Baghdadi was with him.

However, monitoring of the group’s communications in the aftermath of the attack has revealed nothing to suggest that Baghdadi was killed. Officials have not ruled out that he may have been injured.

“We’re still looking at it very closely,” said an Iraqi intelligence official. “There’s nothing yet, and as time ticks on it may be less likely.”

Jihadist forums have remained mute since the strike took place. The death of Baghdadi would be difficult to keep quiet even among the tight discipline of Isis, which has proven difficult for Iraqi, or international agencies, to penetrate ever since it changed the modern face of the Middle East in June when it made rapid territorial gains in Iraq and seized Mosul, the country’s second largest city.

Iraqis officials claimed to have killed two senior Isis members on Saturday in a raid they carried out on the town of al-Qaim near the Syrian border. The raid took place on a house where senior leaders were meeting and is thought to have killed the overall leader of Anbar province, Adnan Latif al-Suweidi, and Isis’s leader in the Euphrates valley, Bashar al-Muhandi. Both held senior leadership positions in the organisation.

Targeted raids, carried out by the US and its Arab allies in the region, have proven effective in slowing the momentum of the group, according to Iraqi officials and one senior Isis member.However, they have failed to curtail its strategic aims.

The air strike near Mosul came hours after Barack Obama said he would double the number of US troops deployed to Iraq to reinforce the offensive against Isis. On Sunday, the US president said the troop surge will place the US on the front foot as it confronts the group.

In his first public comments since his surge announcement, Obama denied it represented a failure of early reliance on air strikes and said the deployment announced on Friday night “signals a new phase” in his campaign against Islamic State – known as Isis or Isil.

“Rather than just try to halt to Isil’s momentum, we are now in a position to start going on some offensive,” he told Face The Nation on CBS.

“The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading Isil’s abilities and slowing the advances they were making, now we need some ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, to start pushing them back.”

The White House insists the new US troops will be focused on training Iraqis to fight Isis and then co-ordinating air strikes, rather that being involved in what it calls an active combat role.

“What hasn’t changed is our troops are not engaged in combat, essentially what we are doing is we are taking four training centres with coalition members that allow us to bring in Iraqi troops, some of the Sunni tribes that are still resisting Isil, giving them proper training, proper equipment, helping them with strategy, helping them with logistics,” said Obama.

Iraqi forces have performed abysmally since Isis stormed into Mosul on 10 June. In the chaotic two days that followed, up to six divisions fled, surrendering their US-supplied advanced weapons. Since then, Shia militias have increasingly taken prominence in most frontlines across the country.

“We will provide them with close air support once they are prepared to start going on the offensive against Isil, but what we won’t be doing is having our own troops do the fighting,” he added.

But the president also refused to rule out further increases in military engagement in Iraq and Syria, which already include daily bombing raids on Isis in both countries.

“As the commander in chief, I am never going to say never,” he said when asked whether more troops would be sent. “But what the commanders presented the plan to me say is that we may actually see fewer troops over time because now we are seeing coalition members starting to partner with us on the training and assist effort.”

Obama insists this time it will be different because attacks on Isis will only be led by Iraqis.

“What we learned from previous engagement in Iraq is that our military is always the best, we can always knock out any threat, but then when we leave that threat comes back,” he said.",official baghdad washington remained unclear sunday fate islamic state isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi key aide killed u air strike near mosul senior iraqi official confirmed guardian aide abdur rahman al athaee also known abu sajar killed attack late friday night hit car convoy southwest isi stronghold athaee known almost constant contact baghdadi official deduced presence convoy likely meant baghdadi however monitoring group communication aftermath attack revealed nothing suggest baghdadi killed official ruled may injured still looking closely said iraqi intelligence official nothing yet time tick may le likely jihadist forum remained mute since strike took place death baghdadi would difficult keep quiet even among tight discipline isi proven difficult iraqi international agency penetrate ever since changed modern face middle east june made rapid territorial gain iraq seized mosul country second largest city iraqi official claimed killed two senior isi member saturday raid carried town al qaim near syrian border raid took place house senior leader meeting thought killed overall leader anbar province adnan latif al suweidi isi leader euphrates valley bashar al muhandi held senior leadership position organisation targeted raid carried u arab ally region proven effective slowing momentum group according iraqi official one senior isi member however failed curtail strategic aim air strike near mosul came hour barack obama said would double number u troop deployed iraq reinforce offensive isi sunday u president said troop surge place u front foot confronts group first public comment since surge announcement obama denied represented failure early reliance air strike said deployment announced friday night signal new phase campaign islamic state known isi isil rather try halt isil momentum position start going offensive told face nation cbs airstrikes effective degrading isil ability slowing advance making need ground troop iraqi ground troop start pushing back white house insists new u troop focused training iraqi fight isi co ordinating air strike rather involved call active combat role changed troop engaged combat essentially taking four training centre coalition member allow u bring iraqi troop sunni tribe still resisting isil giving proper training proper equipment helping strategy helping logistics said obama iraqi force performed abysmally since isi stormed mosul june chaotic two day followed six division fled surrendering u supplied advanced weapon since shia militia increasingly taken prominence frontlines across country provide close air support prepared start going offensive isil troop fighting added president also refused rule increase military engagement iraq syria already include daily bombing raid isi country commander chief never going say never said asked whether troop would sent commander presented plan say may actually see fewer troop time seeing coalition member starting partner u training assist effort obama insists time different attack isi led iraqi learned previous engagement iraq military always best always knock threat leave threat come back said,isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi key aide killed u air strike near mosul senior iraqi official confirmed guardian aide abdur rahman al athaee also known abu sajar killed attack late friday night hit car convoy southwest isi stronghold athaee known almost constant contact baghdadi official deduced presence convoy likely meant baghdadi however monitoring group communication aftermath attack revealed nothing suggest baghdadi killed official
1621,"The female militia fighter became famous after a picture of her making the peace sign went viral on Twitter but Kurdish sources have rejected claims she has been killed

Islamic State terrorists claim to have beheaded the poster girl of the Kurdish militia’s battle for freedom in Syria.

The female fighter, known only by the name Rehana, became famous after a picture of her making the peace sign went viral on Twitter.

She is said to have killed more than 100 jihadists in the battle for the strategically important town of Kobane, on the Turkey-Syria border.

Now IS has claimed that a photo of a grinning rebel holding a woman’s severed head is evidence that she is dead.

But Kurdish journalist Pawan Durani said it was untrue.

He wrote today: “Rehana is very much alive. ISIS supporters just trying to lift morale.

Tigress is hunting for more.

“Let ISIS produce even a single picture of Rehana. Propaganda and falsehood runs in their blood. Rehana keeps hunting them.""

She became a symbol for the Kurdish resistance movement against Islamic State when Pawan tweeted her picture on October 13.

Fighter: 'Rehana' making a peace sign

He wrote: “Rehana has killed more than a hundred ISIS terrorists in Kobane...make her famous for her bravery.”

The photo received over 5,000 retweets and was shared around the world.

Rehana was fighting for the Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which has an Independent Women’s Battalion known as the YPJ.

Estimates suggest that one in three people fighting against ISIS in the Kobane region are female.

Earlier this month it was reported that a female Kurdish fighter had carried out a suicide bomb attack there killing several jihadists.

The efforts of resistance fighters in the town have recently been helped by coalition air support and US arms drops.

But more than 800 people have died in Kobane since Islamic State militants launched their attack on September 16.

The jihadists have lost 481 while 313 Kurds have been killed fighting to defend the area, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The figures do not include ISIS losses to US-led air strikes, which the Pentagon has said run to “several hundred.”

“The aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs,” says the AOL article.

The article also mentions a man who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual. He reportedly thought the creature in question was initially driftwood with a striking resemblance to a crab, but then later explained he now thinks the crab is real.

1626,"The melodic warbling of Justin Bieber is credited with saving a man's life in Europe.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn told the Austrian Times he was fishing in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic when a bear attacked him. The man thought he was done for, but when the bear clawed at him, his cellphone went off. The ringtone, Justin Bieber's ""Baby,"" caused the bear to run away.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone - according to local media the singer's hit 'Baby' - must have startled the bear into halting its attack.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" explained one.

Igor suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.
The bear's actions are completely understandable. Who among us hasn't ran, screeching in a state of panic from the room when Bieber's ""Baby"" is played? I often use ""Baby"" to scare away annoying door-to-door salesman or pesky types like my landlord with her annoying questions about why I haven't paid my rent or what the smell coming from my apartment is. I hear the Pentagon is currently experimenting with using the song in place of a missile defensive system for the United States. Bieber could save this country billions in national defense.

He was found by other fisherman, who used his phone to call for help, Newsy says.

1632,"Jasmine Tridevil's 'three breasts' have gotten their 15 minutes of fame, but they've finally been exposed as a sham after all.

Florida station 10 News has now outed Tridevil third breast as fake after obtaining a luggage theft report filed earlier this month by the 21-year-old at Tampa International Airport.

In the report, Tridevil (going by her real name Alisha Hessler) lists the contents of a bag which was stolen off the American Airlines conveyor belt, including a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' inside.

Cops eventually tracked down the thieves using surveillance footage, and returned Hessler's black nylon bag - but not before taking an official inventory.

Con artist: The 'three-breasted' woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' has been exposed as a phony, after a lost luggage report was released.

Contents: The above property receipt shows that Hessler's suitcase was stolen at Tampa International Aiport and returned earlier this month with a '3 breast prosthesis' inside

Earlier Tuesday, Tridevil's story began to fall apart when internet-rumor site Snopes connected the young woman to a Tampa, Florida massage therapist named Alisha Hessler.

Snopes discovered that the website JasmineTridevil.com is registered to a person named Alisha Hessler, and that Tridevil bares striking resemblance to a Tampa masseuse named Alisha Jasmine Hessler .

A website for Hessler's business - Alisha's Golden Touch - lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoaxes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted women'.

If Alisha Hessler is the woman behind Jasmine Tridevil, it may not be the fist time she has made national news.

In December 2013, a Tampa woman named Alisha Hessler made headlines when she had a alleged attacker stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding up a sign that reads 'I beat women'.

Debunked? Yesterday, a woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' (left) announced that she had undergone plastic surgery to add a third breast. That woman has now been connected to Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler (right) who owns the domain name JasmineTridevil.com. The two women bear a striking likeness

Damning evidence: A website for Hessler's business 'Alisha's Golden Touch' lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoazes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted woman [sic]'

Likeness: YouTube videos of Hessler showing off her massage skills also bare a similarity to Tridevil, who says she underwent the procedure to become unattractive to men

A view of the home where Alisha Jasmine Hessler, aka Jasmine Tridevilm lives in Tampa Florida on Tuesday, September 23

Police tried to contact Hessler about the alleged attack outside a night club but she 'stopped returning [their] calls' and never filed formal charges.

In March 2013, she was taken into custody in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'.

News of Tridevil's third breast emerged Monday, when she announced that she paid $20,000 for the addition in order to become a reality star.

She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention.

She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods.

And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation.

Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man

News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'.

While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet.

A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows.

Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'

Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds.

Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler.

'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.'

Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week.

'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.'

The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage.

In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show

Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com

However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning.

1633,"Transgender teen Leelah Alcorn killed herself by jumping in front of a semi. The 17-year-old Ohio teen left a suicide note blaming her Christian parents for her death. Leelah was upset that her parents would not allow her to get the gender transitioning surgery she desired.

The Ohio transgender teen died during the early hours on Sunday morning in Warren County, along highway I-71. Alcorn left a suicide note on her Tumblr account which has since gone viral. Posting the suicide note, Leelah Alcorn said her Christian parents refused to acknowledge her gender beliefs and forbid her from transitioning into a female.

The Leelah Alcorn suicide note begins by stating, “If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.”

The note posted by the transgender teenager was scheduled to post just several hours after Alcorn committed suicide by walking onto Ohio I-71 in the Kings Mill area and stepping in front of a tractor-trailer.

Ohio transgender teen Joshua Alcorn committed suicide and blame Christian parents.

“When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” the Leelah Acorn suicide note said. “I immediately told my mom and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that is was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

The transgender teen went on to say that her parents would not allow her to transition and began taking her to Christian therapists who allegedly told her that she was “selfish and wrong.” Alcorn added in the suicide note, “I formed a sort of a f**k you attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans, it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them.”

The transgender teen’s viral suicide note goes on to state, “They wanted me to be their prefect little straight Christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

“I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman, who hates herself.”

Another excerpt from the suicide letter reads, “So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for five months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually, they realized they didn’t actually give a sh*t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.”

The remainder of Alcorn’s suicide letter states, “After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like sh*t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say ‘it gets better’ but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

“That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry, if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100 percent of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a sh*t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier, the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Goodbye, (Leelah) Josh Alcorn”

1635,"A wicked aunt cut her three-year-old nephew’s penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her phone.

Evil Xue Paan, 37, was sending text messages to her boyfriend while sitting on the toilet when toddler Qiang Qiang walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile.

But instead of giving him the phone, the fuming aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and severed the boy’s penis while his mother was visiting a next-door neighbour in Luohe, a city in central China’s Henan Province.

Horrified mum Cai Tuan, 27, said: ""I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

""I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.

""Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

""Next to him was a knife and his penis.

""It was simply horrific.

""My sister, his aunt, had gone.""

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the member and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said: ""Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

""However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.""

A police spokesman said: ""The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.""

1636,"If the bizarre story about Joan Rivers' doctor pausing to take a ""selfie"" in the operating room minutes before the 81-year-old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on August 29 sounded outlandish, that's because it was.
So says Dr Gwen Korovin, Rivers' personal physician who on Thursday night shot down a CNN report claiming Korovin was so star-struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together.

CNN, citing sources close to the investigation being carried out by the medical examiner's office, is standing by its claim that a sedated Rivers was clearly visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie - an allegation Korovin's lawyers are calling ""lies"".

Korovin, (known as the ""patron saint of Broadway singers and actors"" for her work tending to the likes of Lady Gaga, Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Celine Dion, Mick Jagger and Luciano Pavarotti) also ""categorically"" denied performing an unauthorised biopsy on Rivers which, according to multiple published reports, caused the heart attack that killed the beloved New Yorker during what should have been a routine medical procedure.

Whatever Rivers would have made of the escalating drama surrounding her mysterious death, those close to her say she would be thrilled by the news that Vanity Fair scribe Leslie Bennetts has been signed to write her biography, due out early next year.

""Joan Rivers' life story was, in every way, a remarkably dramatic roller-coaster ride characterised by triumphant highs and devastating lows, one that is both wildly entertaining and deeply moving,"" Bennetts said in a statement. ""It's hard to imagine a more compelling subject for a book or one that would be more fun."" And lucrative. Within hours of Rivers' death, sales of her latest book (Diary of a Mad Diva) shot up an impressive - and record-breaking - 70,750pc on Amazon.

Garth Brooks seems to think his Irish fans weren't that put out by the Croke Park debacle. In the run-up to his latest seven-performance run, which kicked off in Atlanta on Friday night, the self-effacing singer-songwriter made reference to his cancelled Irish gigs when asked what the secret is behind his ongoing appeal.

""I wish I could explain it: Of course - I'm beautiful, are you kidding me? I'm talented,"" the 52-year-old joked with reporters. ""But I don't get it...If the Garth guy shows up or not, these guys are still going to have the same great time,"" he said, using his Irish fans as a case in point. ""We saw video footage of people in Ireland, at a bar the night we were supposed to be there, singing Friends in Low Places and they were having the time of their lives... It's like it's their show."" As if.

Dowd deals with pot shots

Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Maureen Dowd is on quite a high after learning that she has been cast as the poster girl for a new ""Consume Responsibly"" edible pot publicity campaign.

The 62-year-old New York Times op-ed columnist, who got (unintentionally) stoned last summer while researching a story about Colorado's recent decision to legalise the use of recreational marijuana, doesn't even mind that the pro-pot brigade are making fun of her nightmare experience with cannabis to warn rookies about the dangers of overdosing.

Dowd, who decided to test the benefits of pot with a few bites of a weed-infused chocolate bar wrote about the results (""What could go wrong?"") in a column (titled ""Don't Harsh Our Mellow, Dude"") which was published in June, graphically recalling how - an hour after ingesting the bar, things went haywire.

""I barely made it from the desk to the bed, where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours... I was panting and paranoid, sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and I didn't answer, he'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy,"" she wrote.

""As my paranoia deepened, I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me.""

A medical consultant would later tell Dowd that marijuana candy bars ""are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices,"" a point she used to condemn the marijuana industry for promoting the drug without safety precautions for first-time users.

On Wednesday, the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) responded to Dowd's criticism by unveiling a giant billboard featuring a red-haired woman (who looks exactly like the writer) obviously worse for wear on a hotel room bed. ""Don't let a candy bar ruin your vacation,"" reads the tagline. ""With edibles, start low and go slow.""

Dowd, who wasn't in the slightest fazed at her likeness or her story being used in the ad said she has her own plans for artwork from the billboard.

""I'm going to make it my Christmas card. Now,"" she said, adding dryly, ""onto gun control.""",bizarre story joan river doctor pausing take selfie operating room minute year old comedienne went cardiac arrest august sounded outlandish say dr gwen korovin river personal physician thursday night shot cnn report claiming korovin star struck took opportunity celebrity patient unconscious snap souvenir photo two together cnn citing source close investigation carried medical examiner office standing claim sedated river clearly visible korovin procedure room selfie allegation korovin lawyer calling lie korovin known patron saint broadway singer actor work tending like lady gaga hugh jackman julie andrew celine dion mick jagger luciano pavarotti also categorically denied performing unauthorised biopsy river according multiple published report caused heart attack killed beloved new yorker routine medical procedure whatever river would made escalating drama surrounding mysterious death close say would thrilled news vanity fair scribe leslie bennett signed write biography due early next year joan river life story every way remarkably dramatic roller coaster ride characterised triumphant high devastating low one wildly entertaining deeply moving bennett said statement hard imagine compelling subject book one would fun lucrative within hour river death sale latest book diary mad diva shot impressive record breaking pc amazon lost translation garth brook seems think irish fan put croke park debacle run latest seven performance run kicked atlanta friday night self effacing singer songwriter made reference cancelled irish gig asked secret behind ongoing appeal wish could explain course beautiful kidding talented year old joked reporter get garth guy show guy still going great time said using irish fan case point saw video footage people ireland bar night supposed singing friend low place time life like show dowd deal pot shot pulitzer prize winning journalist maureen dowd quite high learning cast poster girl new consume responsibly edible pot publicity campaign year old new york time op ed columnist got unintentionally stoned last summer researching story colorado recent decision legalise use recreational marijuana even mind pro pot brigade making fun nightmare experience cannabis warn rookie danger overdosing dowd decided test benefit pot bite weed infused chocolate bar wrote result could go wrong column titled harsh mellow dude published june graphically recalling hour ingesting bar thing went haywire barely made desk bed lay curled hallucinatory state next eight hour panting paranoid sure room service waiter knocked answer call police arrested unable handle candy wrote paranoia deepened became convinced died one telling medical consultant would later tell dowd marijuana candy bar supposed cut piece novice point used condemn marijuana industry promoting drug without safety precaution first time user wednesday advocacy group marijuana policy project mpp responded dowd criticism unveiling giant billboard featuring red haired woman look exactly like writer obviously worse wear hotel room bed let candy bar ruin vacation read tagline edible start low go slow dowd slightest fazed likeness story used ad said plan artwork billboard going make christmas card said adding dryly onto gun control,joan river doctor pausing take selfie operating room minute year old comedienne went cardiac arrest august sounded outlandish say dr gwen korovin river personal physician thursday night shot cnn report claiming korovin star struck took opportunity celebrity patient unconscious snap souvenir photo two together cnn citing source close investigation carried medical examiner office standing claim sedated river clearly visible korovin procedure room selfie allegation dr gwen kor

1643,"Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman reportedly plans to split the company in two, becoming chair of a new company with its PC and printer business and CEO of a new company with its corporate hardware and services businesses.

Hewlett-Packard plans to break into two companies in a move that would create separate personal computer/printer and corporate hardware/services businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

The report cited unnamed sources who said the plan could be announced as early as Monday.

The split would be done as a tax-free distribution of stock to shareholders next year, one of the Journal's sources said.

It would be the second big breakup of a Silicon Valley tech powerhouse in a week, following eBay's plan to spin off PayPal. It also comes in the wake of Oracle's announcement that Larry Ellison was handing the CEO reins over to former HP CEO Mark Hurd and Safra Catz.

The move by HP has long been speculated upon and follows the 2011 exploration of a spinoff of the PC business during Leo Apotheker's stormy and short tenure as CEO.

Current CEO Meg Whitman reorganized the company to combine the PC and printer units, which are leaders in shrinking businesses. HP was No. 1 in PCs until last year when it slipped behind China's Lenovo Group Ltd.

The Journal said that Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the other enterprise-focused business. Lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation will be CEO of that business.

HP brought in $55.9 billion in revenue from its printing and personal systems group last year, about half of its total. But sales dropped by about 7.1 percent in the unit, compared to a 6.7 percent drop for the company as a whole.",hewlett packard ceo meg whitman reportedly plan split company two becoming chair new company pc printer business ceo new company corporate hardware service business hewlett packard plan break two company move would create separate personal computer printer corporate hardware service business wall street journal reported sunday report cited unnamed source said plan could announced early monday split would done tax free distribution stock shareholder next year one journal source said would second big breakup silicon valley tech powerhouse week following ebay plan spin paypal also come wake oracle announcement larry ellison handing ceo rein former hp ceo mark hurd safra catz move hp long speculated upon follows exploration spinoff pc business leo apotheker stormy short tenure ceo current ceo meg whitman reorganized company combine pc printer unit leader shrinking business hp pc last year slipped behind china lenovo group ltd journal said whitman chairman pc printer business ceo enterprise focused business lead independent director patricia russo chairman enterprise company dion weisler executive pc printer operation ceo business hp brought billion revenue printing personal system group last year half total sale dropped percent unit compared percent drop company whole,ceo meg whitman reportedly plan split company two becoming chair new company pc printer business ceo new company corporate hardware service business hewlett packard plan break two company move would create separate personal computer printer corporate hardware service business wall street journal reported sunday report cited unnamed source said plan could announce early monday split would done tax free distribution stock shareholder next year one journal source said would second big breakup silicon valley tech powerhouse week following ebay plan spin paypal also come wake oracle announcement la
1650,"Kim Jong-un's health said to be at risk due to his high cheese consumption

31-year-old imports vast quantities of Swiss Emmental - his favourite variety

His weight has ballooned in recent months and he now walks with a limp

But experts think weight gain may be deliberate to look like late grandfather

Kim Jong-un is putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, it has been claimed.

The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so in recent months that he now walks with a limp.

Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state with the title Eternal President of the Republic.

Weight gain: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions

Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat.

Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror.

North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung.

He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s.

Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.

'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'

North Korea is not accepting American offers to send a high-level envoy to seek the release of three detained Americans, it has been claimed.

Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, said freeing the detainees could provide a diplomatic opening between the nations, also snared by Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons.

But he said Washington would not give into attempts to 'extort' political gain from the detentions.

North Korea this week sentenced 24-year-old Matthew Miller of Bakersfield, California, to six years hard labor, deepening U.S. concern over the cases.

Miller, who according to the court tore up his visa on arrival in Pyongyang in April, was convicted of entering the country illegally to commit espionage.

Another trial is expected soon for Jeffrey Fowle, of Miamisburg, Ohio, who was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at a sailor's club.

Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production.

Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a top quality local cheese the despot ordered the three specialists to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College.

Although the college 'politely but firmly' rejected the request, Kim remains determined to improve standards at the country's main cheese factory.

He is understood to be furious that the Pyongyang Dairy has continually failed to produce an Emmental-style cheese of a high enough quality to satisfy his demands.

The news comes as North Korea branded the U.S. 'a graveyard of human rights', criticising the nation in the wake of the Missouri riots following the shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

China, Iran and Russia have previously criticised America following the shooting and the crackdown on protesters following the shooting in the town of Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis.

North Korea, which is regularly condemned by Washington over allegations of human rights abuses, has now added its voice to those highlighting America's flaws, saying it should 'mind its own business' rather than interfering in the other countries' internal affairs.",kim jong un health said risk due high cheese consumption year old import vast quantity swiss emmental favourite variety weight ballooned recent month walk limp expert think weight gain may deliberate look like late grandfather kim jong un putting health serious risk due dangerously high consumption emmental cheese claimed year old north korean leader got taste cheese student switzerland understood love much import vast quantity despite western sanction unhealthy appetite emmental also known swiss cheese believed key factor kim weight ballooning recent month walk limp expert believe kim may deliberately gaining weight order look like grandfather kim il sung venerated north korea nation founder even exactly year death still considered head state title eternal president republic scroll video weight gain north korean leader kim jong un got taste cheese student switzerland understood love much import vast quantity despite western sanction kim jong un unhealthy obsession emmental led importing vast quantity cheese consumption despite million north korean struggling find enough eat malnutrition widespread famine often break country still reliant foreign food aid result economic mismanagement loss soviet support despite suffering million citizen kim continues gorge swiss cheese vast quantity waistline expanding dangerously rapid rate according mirror north korean managed flee country believe weight gain may deliberate order look like corpulent late grandfather kim il sung established pervasive cult personality around turning north korea oppressive single party socialist state early defector cho myung chul korea institute international economic policy said north korean think fat good unlike south korean want skinny high chance jong un intentionally gained weight look like il sung inspiration expert believe kim jong un may using love emmental left deliberately gain weight order look like corpulent grandfather late kim il sung right north korea accepting american offer send high level envoy seek release three detained american claimed robert king u special envoy north korean human right issue said freeing detainee could provide diplomatic opening nation also snared pyongyang development nuclear weapon said washington would give attempt extort political gain detention north korea week sentenced year old matthew miller bakersfield california six year hard labor deepening u concern case miller according court tore visa arrival pyongyang april convicted entering country illegally commit espionage another trial expected soon jeffrey fowle miamisburg ohio arrested may leaving bible sailor club earlier year revealed kim tried send team food expert french city besancon crash course dairy production tired country bland attempt produce top quality local cheese despot ordered three specialist spend several month national dairy industry college although college politely firmly rejected request kim remains determined improve standard country main cheese factory understood furious pyongyang dairy continually failed produce emmental style cheese high enough quality satisfy demand news come north korea branded u graveyard human right criticising nation wake missouri riot following shooting unarmed black teenager china iran russia previously criticised america following shooting crackdown protester following shooting town ferguson suburb st louis north korea regularly condemned washington allegation human right abuse added voice highlighting america flaw saying mind business rather interfering country internal affair,kim jong un health said risk due high cheese consumption year old import vast quantity swiss emmental favourite variety weight ballooned recent month walk limp expert think weight gain may deliberate look like grandfather kim jong un putting health serious risk due dangerously high consumption emmental cheese claimed year old north korean leader got taste cheese student switzerland understood love much import vast quantity despite western sanction kim jong un unhealthy obsession emmental cheese claimed kim
1653,"Igor Vorozhbitsyn was going fishing in Yakutia Republic when the bear began to maul him. But Bieber’s ‘Baby’ had been installed as a ringtone on his phone — and caused the bear to stop and flee after he got a call.

Justin Bieber saved a Russian fisherman from the clutches of a killer bear.

The deadly beast bolted after hearing the pop brat's smash hit ""Baby"" blasting out of Igor Vorozhbitsyn's cellphone.

The 42-year-old was walking to his favorite angling spot in the Yakutia Republic when the animal pounced.

As it clawed his face, the rodman feared he was about to be killed.

But then his cell phone started to ring and the Bieber tone installed by his granddaughter startled his attacker, who fled back into the forest.

Vorozhbitsyn, who suffered deep cuts and bruises to his face and chest, then used his cell to call for help.

""I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,"" he told the Croatian Times.

""I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" he added.

1655,"KGI Securities' Ming Chi Kuo, one of the most accurate analysts when it comes to predicting Apple's product lineup, says the Apple Watch will be released in March, according to MacRumors.

And, Apple is expected to make some announcements about the watch soon.

This follows previous reports from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman that also said Apple's first wearable will hit store shelves in March.

Although Apple detailed most of the watch's features back in September, Kuo thinks we'll learn even more about the Apple Watch shortly before its release. Apple will offer more specifics on battery life, Kuo says, which has been a point of contention since the watch was announced.

The company previously said you'd have to charge it nightly, but didn't reveal an exact battery life estimate. Gurman reports that Apple is targeting between 2.5 and 4 hours of active use and 19 hours of mixed standby and active use.

1662,"BOURNE, Mass. —The three Afghani soldiers who disappeared during a training exercise at a Cape Cod military base this weekend have been found, a high-level law enforcement source tells Team 5.

The Afghan soldiers had been participating in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise at Joint Base Cape Cod, U.S. military officials said. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis Saturday night.

The source tells Team 5's Karen Anderson the men were taken into custody at the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/US border crossing near Niagara Falls on Monday. The men told Customs Agents they were refugees, the source said.

They were identified as Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar.

""They were here for a multi-national military exercise, which had been scheduled for a long time. They have been here for a couple of weeks. There’s a lot of speculation that within the military they maybe be trying to defect,"" Gov. Deval Patrick said.

The three were among 12 members of the Afghanistan National Army participating in a military exercise that focused on tactical strategies, said Lt. Col. James Sahady of the Massachusetts National Guard.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday.

Last month, Maj. Gen. Harold Greene was killed by an Afghan soldier in an attack in Afghanistan.

Last weekend, two Afghan policemen in the Washington, D.C., for a DEA training program at Quantico, Virginia, also went missing while on a sightseeing trip to Georgetown, ABC News reported. The DEA said the two men left the group because they did not want to go back to Afghanistan.",bourne mass three afghani soldier disappeared training exercise cape cod military base weekend found high level law enforcement source tell team afghan soldier participating u central command regional cooperation training exercise joint base cape cod u military official said arrived camp edward sept last seen cape cod mall hyannis saturday night source tell team karen anderson men taken custody rainbow bridge canadian u border crossing near niagara fall monday men told custom agent refugee source said identified major jan mohammad arash captain mohammad nasir askarzada captain noorullah aminyar multi national military exercise scheduled long time couple week lot speculation within military maybe trying defect gov deval patrick said three among member afghanistan national army participating military exercise focused tactical strategy said lt col james sahady massachusetts national guard regional cooperation training exercise held annually since promote cooperation interoperability among force build functional capacity practice peacekeeping operation enhance readiness year exercise involves participant six nation including u wrap wednesday last month maj gen harold greene killed afghan soldier attack afghanistan last weekend two afghan policeman washington c dea training program quantico virginia also went missing sightseeing trip georgetown abc news reported dea said two men left group want go back afghanistan,u central command regional cooperation training exercise joint base cape cod u military official said arrived camp edward sept last seen cape cod mall hyannis saturday night source tell team karen anderson men taken custody rainbow bridge canadian u border crossing near niagara fall monday men told custom agent refugee source said identified major jan mohammad arash captain mohammad nasir askarzada captain noorullah aminy

The controversial decision did not go down well with the rejected groom’s family, who reportedly tried to force Indira to change her decision.

The rejected groom also tried to make his would-be bride change her mind, claiming he would not be able to face his friends following the embarrassing episode.

Several guests at the wedding, which took place in the city of Rampur, were arrested after a fight broke out, says the Times of India report.

1664,"'After seeing my young son's body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die' Reza Gul said after Taliban fighters attacked her son's police outpost in the western Farah province on Nov. 17. Gul is being hailed as a hero after she helped fend off the militants.

The mother of an Afghan policeman gunned down by the Taliban reportedly went on a revenge-fuelled spree, helping kill 25 militants in an act that's being hailed as heroic among her countrymen.

When her son's police outpost came under attack in the Balabolok district of western Farah province on Nov. 17, Reza Gul said she rushed to the scene, found her son dead and picked up his gun, NBC News reported.

""The Taliban attacked our village and my son's outpost at dawn,"" Gul told NBC News. ""After seeing my young son's body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die.""

Gul and other family members, including her daughter and daughter-in-law, took part in a seven-hour gun battle between police and militants that left 25 Taliban dead and five more wounded, Khaama Press reported.

""The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons,"" Gul's daughter-in-law, Seema, told Tolo News. ""We were committed to fight until the last bullet.""

The family went head-to-head with up to 400 militants and eventually drove off the fighters.

""We are proud of the bravery of this family and this is a saga that will be remembered for long by police and residents of Farah province,"" Gen. Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, the provincial police chief, told Tolo News.

1668,"Major Mariam Al Mansouri became the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) first female pilot on the ISIS terrorist group terrorist group following the announcement that the United States would be leading a coalition of nations to use airstrikes against the Islamic State. While the world celebrates her success, the war has come home for Mansouri and reports are claiming the female fight pilot’s family has officially disowned her.

In a related report by The Inquisitr, the 35-year-old Major Mariam Al Mansouri was among three other women that were part of the attack on ISIS. She graduated in January of 2008 and she said that being a military almost entirely dominated by men was a dream she’s held for years.

“It was my aspiration. Ever since I finished high school, I wanted to learn flying because it was something that I liked in the first place. Being in the air force is a responsibility. I feel proud, especially that I am part of the first batch. And that encourages me to continue in this field. As a pilot, you have to study all the time, even after graduation. You have to continue training because the more hours you fly the more experience you accumulate.”

Mansouri led three other UAE F-16 pilots in the first airstrike and it’s said that when the “U.S. tanker pilots called in for air refueling and asked for the UAE mission and when they heard a female voice on the other side they paused for 20 seconds.” They then proceeded to drop bombs this week in coordinated attacks against Islamic State strongholds near Raqqa, Aleppo and Idlib.

Unfortunately, an Arabic language news site called Wattan.TV is reporting that Mariam Al Mansouri’s family has disowned her for these actions. Please keep in mind this is a Google translation and is extremely rough. The Inquisitr did attempt to clean up the translation, but it’s possible there were translation errors introduced in the process.

“The Mansouri family in the UAE announced Wednesday that they had Nbaraha [untranslated] of her daughter Mary because of her participation in the international coalition led by the United States to strike at civilian targets inside Syrian territory. The family also stressed their support for the Syrian revolution. The Mansouri family said in a statement published by news sites Arabic…. ‘We are the sons of the family of al-Mansuri in the United Arab Emirates announce to fill the innocence [translation error?] of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. We remind anyone who participates in international aggression on the Syrian people, led by the daughter of the rogue Mariam Al Mansouri, that the the Islamic State in the East and the West has a duty to defend issues of the nation. We exhort the jihad for the sake of Allah and the support of the Syrian Revolution. Blessed, in the face of the descendants of Ibn Alqami.'”

The Mansouri family also called for support for the Syrian revolution, calling for “all factions and battalions operating on the scene Shamiyah to unite and join forces and efforts to a single goal, which is to drop the Assad regime.” The family also appears to have announced support specifically for the ISIS terrorist organization, saying that their family is “honored heroes of the Sunnis in Iraq and the Levant.” The ISIS terrorist group is also known as ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, although it’s possible this similarity to the ISIS name may be a Google translation error.",major mariam al mansouri became united arab emirate uae first female pilot isi terrorist group terrorist group following announcement united state would leading coalition nation use airstrikes islamic state world celebrates success war come home mansouri report claiming female fight pilot family officially disowned related report inquisitr year old major mariam al mansouri among three woman part attack isi graduated january said military almost entirely dominated men dream held year aspiration ever since finished high school wanted learn flying something liked first place air force responsibility feel proud especially part first batch encourages continue field pilot study time even graduation continue training hour fly experience accumulate mansouri led three uae f pilot first airstrike said u tanker pilot called air refueling asked uae mission heard female voice side paused second proceeded drop bomb week coordinated attack islamic state stronghold near raqqa aleppo idlib unfortunately arabic language news site called wattan tv reporting mariam al mansouri family disowned action please keep mind google translation extremely rough inquisitr attempt clean translation possible translation error introduced process mansouri family uae announced wednesday nbaraha untranslated daughter mary participation international coalition led united state strike civilian target inside syrian territory family also stressed support syrian revolution mansouri family said statement published news site arabic son family al mansuri united arab emirate announce fill innocence translation error called mariam al mansouri remind anyone participates international aggression syrian people led daughter rogue mariam al mansouri islamic state east west duty defend issue nation exhort jihad sake allah support syrian revolution blessed face descendant ibn alqami mansouri family also called support syrian revolution calling faction battalion operating scene shamiyah unite join force effort single goal drop assad regime family also appears announced support specifically isi terrorist organization saying family honored hero sunni iraq levant isi terrorist group also known isil stand islamic state iraq levant although possible similarity isi name may google translation error,uae first female pilot isi terrorist group terrorist group following announcement united state would leading coalition nation use airstrikes islamic state world celebrates success war come home mansouri report claiming female fight pilot family officially disowned related report inquisitr year old major mariam al mansouri among three woman part attack isi graduated january said military almost entirely dominated men dream held year aspiration ever since finished high school wanted learn flying something liked first place air force responsibility feel proud especially part
1674,"Startling new information has come out surrounding Joan Rivers death.

A staffer at Manhattan’s Yorkville Endoscopy clinic said the doctor who performed a biopsy on Rivers’ vocal cords, right before her death, took a selfie while Rivers was under anesthesia.

It's believed that Rivers went into cardiac arrest during the unauthorized biopsy because of a lack of oxygen flow to her lungs. After that Rivers was taken to Mt. Sinai hospital where she passed away a week later.

The unidentified doctor is believed to be Rivers' ear-nose-throat doctor who was not certified to perform that procedure.

An investigation of the Yorkville clinic is still ongoing.

1677,"BlackBerry takeover rumours are nothing new, and this week Lenovo could be the company lining up to take over the struggling Canadian manufacturer.
As far as rumours go, it has potential. After all, Lenovo tried to purchase the company back in October last year. Ultimately Lenovo was blocked by the Canadian government because BlackBerry's telecom infrastructure has ties to national security.
Now though, ""a source familar with the matter"" has given Benzinga the heads up that Lenovo is prepared to try again.
Bailing out the 'Berry?

According to the site, the Chinese company is prepared to offer $15.00 a share as an initial offer and finish with a done deal at $18.00 per share.

Moreover, the rumours proclaim the deal will be done as soon as this week. Unsurprisingly, neither company has commented on this rumour.
Optimistic market watchers might point to BlackBerry's re-emergence, care of new CEO John Chen and the new BlackBerry Passport flagship phone. However, the company has still seen a huge decline in its user base and is not in an enviable position compared to cash-rich tech rivals.
Lenovo, for its part, seems to be on a bit of a mobile spending spree. The company bought Motorola Mobility from Google for around $2.91 billion at the start of the year.
We'll have to wait and see whether the current rumours prove true.

1684,"A Grade 4 student was reportedly suspended from his Texas school after he threatened to make another boy disappear with his Lord of the Rings replica ring.

Jason Steward told the Odessa American that his son had seen The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies last weekend and got himself a replica of fabled One Ring.

Steward said his son wore it to Kermit Elementary School, where he told another boy the ring's magic could make him disappear.

Steward said the principal told him no threats would be tolerated — even magical ones.

The school wouldn't comment on the suspension, citing privacy concerns.

The boy has been in trouble before, his father said — once for referring to another child's skin colour, and once for bringing a children's book to school that had a chapter about pregnancy.

But the dad assured the New York Daily News the nine-year-old Tolkien enthusiast is not dangerous.

1685,"There are few topics in the NHL that get people buzzing like expansion and relocation do. Drop some morsel of news in the dead of August, and it’s like tossing the last bite of a Shake Shack burger to a flock of pigeons in Central Park.

On Tuesday, Tony Gallagher and Howard Bloom chucked their meat and the flock went crazy. Gallagher said that NHL expansion to Las Vegas was a “done deal,” and then Bloom upped the ante by claiming that the NHL will add Vegas, Seattle, a second Toronto franchise and Quebec City by 2017, the 100th anniversary of the League.

(No word on whether the League will begin an aggressive cloning program to fill out those rosters with NHL-level talent. Protect your comb, Jonathan Toews, they’re coming for DNA samples!)

Bill Daly of the NHL said the four-team expansion is ""not in"" the NHL's plans. Because what else is he supposed to say...

Gallagher of The Province wrote with finality that the NHL was coming to Las Vegas through expansion:

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

You know, we started getting an inkling that Bettman had changed his tune on Las Vegas when he moved one of the league’s signature promotional events there in 2009, but yes, this is a considerable about-face indeed!

So, in summary, expansion to Las Vegas is a “done deal” except for the fact that there isn’t an ownership group that’s been approved by the Board of Governors; nor is there an expansion fee established for the market that would, in theory, determine who’s willing to buy-in (oooh, Vegas parlance!).

Look, we’re all in total squee-mode for a team in Vegas. Or really any declaration that expansion is going to happen. But the proliferation of this “done deal” report – by Tony Gallagher, no less – is the most Hockey August moment in the history of Hockey August.

For the love of Balsillie, he actually writes “the only thing to be determined” is the group actually owning the team. That’s like writing, “The Penguins are going to trade for a first-line winger. They just need to find a team that will trade them one.”

Is Vegas a done deal? Of course not.

Is it likely? Connecting the dots, one could draw that conclusion.

MGM Grand and AEG aren’t building a $375 million arena to house a Carrot Top repertoire. The NHL didn’t structure its realigned conferences with 16 in the East and 14 in the West to make things easier for Winnipeg. And with the NHL pulling in record revenue, attendance and ratings, the iron hasn’t been hotter to strike for expansion.

But as we’ve noted previously about Vegas: It’s unlike any other market in professional sports. There’s unrivaled competition for entertainment dollars. Many of the people who would attend the games as local fans are working while the games are being played. The largest target audience for the team would be the casinos who fill the considerable luxury box space in the new arena and tourists who pop in to see a game while in Sin City – or, perhaps, get comp’d for one.

It wouldn’t surprise us in the least to see the NHL dive into the market, despite those mysteries, just to be first ones in and because Bettman obviously believes an association with Vegas brings some level of prestige to the League.

But what about the other three teams?

Bloom, of Sports Business News, reported later on Tuesday that the NHL was going full-on expansiongasm by adding every city that it’s considering adding for the last several years. Four new franchises, none through relocation:

“NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”

If you’ve been following the Seattle angle, you know the situation: Chris Hansen – the billionaire, not the predator catcher – has an arena construction deal with the city that hangs on attracting an NBA team; the only hope for an NHL team there first is if Hansen has a change of heart, and Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman is working with him to that end.

Then comes the real fight: Convincing a city council that has otherwise been apathetic to hockey to turn on the funding faucet for an NHL team’s arena.

Then there’s Quebec City, which will have an NHL-ready arena next year and has no shortage of financial powerhouses ready to step up for an expansion franchise. It’s also been the most public and hubristic bid for a team, otherwise known as the opposite of how Gary Bettman likes to operate.

Then there’s a second team in Toronto, which remains the best idea out of all of these options. Then again, what media conglomerates are left to own a team there? The Score app?

And what level of bribery to the Leafs would it take to even crack that market?

Bloom believes this will happen because the NHL won’t be able to keep itself from collecting that expansion franchise windfall, and that’s as solid a theory as any. It makes sense that the League would expand quickly before losing that expansion money to another relocation (/casts an eye at Florida and Arizona).

All of this makes sense from a timing perspective and, of course, because we understand the League’s avarice. There are still significant obstacles in a couple of these markets, but it’s not outrageous to think it could happen.

Which leaves us with the biggest decisions of all: The nicknames! Seattle Sasquatch, Las Vegas Craps, Quebec Nordiques (‘natch) and Toronto Rakes (the sworn enemy of Leafs)!",topic nhl get people buzzing like expansion relocation drop morsel news dead august like tossing last bite shake shack burger flock pigeon central park tuesday tony gallagher howard bloom chucked meat flock went crazy gallagher said nhl expansion la vega done deal bloom upped ante claiming nhl add vega seattle second toronto franchise quebec city th anniversary league word whether league begin aggressive cloning program fill roster nhl level talent protect comb jonathan toews coming dna sample bill daly nhl said four team expansion nhl plan else supposed say gallagher province wrote finality nhl coming la vega expansion source close situation indicated la vega done deal thing determined owner entitled proclaim brought first major league sport franchise sin city given dead set team gambling commissioner year ago move another player friendly state tax free zone represents considerable face indeed know started getting inkling bettman changed tune la vega moved one league signature promotional event yes considerable face indeed summary expansion la vega done deal except fact ownership group approved board governor expansion fee established market would theory determine willing buy oooh vega parlance look total squee mode team vega really declaration expansion going happen proliferation done deal report tony gallagher le hockey august moment history hockey august love balsillie actually writes thing determined group actually owning team like writing penguin going trade first line winger need find team trade one vega done deal course likely connecting dot one could draw conclusion mgm grand aeg building million arena house carrot top repertoire nhl structure realigned conference east west make thing easier winnipeg nhl pulling record revenue attendance rating iron hotter strike expansion noted previously vega unlike market professional sport unrivaled competition entertainment dollar many people would attend game local fan working game played largest target audience team would casino fill considerable luxury box space new arena tourist pop see game sin city perhaps get comp one surprise u least see nhl dive market despite mystery first one bettman obviously belief association vega brings level prestige league three team bloom sport business news reported later tuesday nhl going full expansiongasm adding every city considering adding last several year four new franchise none relocation nhl expansion four team added quebec city toronto seattle la vega b expansion fee following seattle angle know situation chris hansen billionaire predator catcher arena construction deal city hang attracting nba team hope nhl team first hansen change heart vancouver billionaire victor coleman working end come real fight convincing city council otherwise apathetic hockey turn funding faucet nhl team arena quebec city nhl ready arena next year shortage financial powerhouse ready step expansion franchise also public hubristic bid team otherwise known opposite gary bettman like operate second team toronto remains best idea option medium conglomerate left team score app level bribery leaf would take even crack market bloom belief happen nhl able keep collecting expansion franchise windfall solid theory make sense league would expand quickly losing expansion money another relocation cast eye florida arizona make sense timing perspective course understand league avarice still significant obstacle couple market outrageous think could happen leaf u biggest decision nickname seattle sasquatch la vega crap quebec nordiques natch toronto rake sworn enemy leaf,la vega done deal bloom upped ante claiming nhl add vega seattle second toronto franchise quebec city th anniversary league word whether league begin aggressive cloning program fill roster nhl level talent protect comb jonathan toews coming dna sample bill daly nhl said four team expansion la vega done deal bloom upped ante claiming nhl add vega seattle second toront

1691,"Saudi Arabia still doesn’t know what year it is.

Saudi Arabia’s national airline, Saudia is allegedly considering seating male and female passengers apart from each other, according to Emirates247. The airline has cited complaints from male passengers who don’t like unknown men being seated next to their wives when they fly. Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.” The airline will supposedly begin having airport staff assign separate seating for men and women, unless they are closely related.

It’s not only Muslims that are concerned over seating assignments, but also Orthodox Jews. An El Al Airlines flight in September from New York to Israel was delayed because some men refused to be seated next to women…

According to a post on Mashable, a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers. However, we should be cautions here — companies often deny they’re working on a new product or procedure, and then all of a sudden it’s introduced as a “surprise.”",saudi arabia still know year saudi arabia national airline saudia allegedly considering seating male female passenger apart according emirate airline cited complaint male passenger like unknown men seated next wife fly saudia assistant manager marketing abdul rahman al fahd said solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger airline supposedly begin airport staff assign separate seating men woman unless closely related muslim concerned seating assignment also orthodox jew el al airline flight september new york israel delayed men refused seated next woman according post mashable marketing manager airline denying plan segregate passenger however caution company often deny working new product procedure sudden introduced surprise,saudi arabia still know year saudi arabia national airline saudia allegedly considering seating male female passenger apart according to emirate airline cited complaint male passenger like unknown men seated next wife fly saudia assistant manager marketing abdul rahman al fahd said solution problem soon enforce rule satisfy passenger airline supposedly begin airport staff assign separate seating men woman unless closely related muslim concerned seating assignment also orthodox jew el al airline flight september new york israel
1694,"It is reported from Saudi Arabia that it has introduced a new law - which prohibits women from having the ""tempting eyes"". But the news is from 2011, and it seems not even sue.

""A new law in Saudi Arabia, forcing women to wear full veils, if their eyes are considered too 'tempting'. It reports the British Metro and refers to a krönikeliknande opinion text from the Assyrian news agency Aina. ""

So writes the Omni in a short news text published on Wednesday evening, and join the ranks thus to a wide range of international media and web pages in recent days reported the same news. Including British Metro , US news website Inquisitr and Serbian Telegraph .

They all use the article from the news agency Aina source. The article is published on October 30, and is - as Omni mention - written in, and colored by, a personal tone . But not only that: it is also written by the legendary musician Cole Porter, who is mentioned in the article, but died in 1964. At least according to the article's byline .

Old news - from 2011

Does this sound fishy? It's weird. In fact, namely, the full text of the news agency Ainas article copied outright, from a post on the site the Daily Beast - published on 19 November 2011.

Even then, in 2011, circulated the news of the Saudi law widely, and published, among other things, the British Daily Mail . The original source of the time seems to have been an article on the site bikyamasr.com. There are today a weird Russian blog titled ""Business World"", but through service Internet Archive can the old article from November 16, 2011 read. The text sets out no earlier source.

So it is a three year old news now circulating as new. This results in multiple abnormalities. Under the text ""Prince Naif supports the new law"" links such as Omni to an article published this week on the site firsttoknow.com, alleging that ""Prince Naif, the Saudi throne appears to be an equally cruel ruler like his father King Abdullah, has spoken out in full support for the new law. ""

But that claim is not particularly new, but comes from the publications that were made in 2011 - Prince Naif, or Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud as his real name was, namely, died in 2012.

""Religious police deny""

Abdulhadi Khalaf is a lecturer in Sociology at Lund University and expert on the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, and he says he has not heard about this news myself. Later he emailed a link.

- It is evident that the ""religious police"" has denied that it has issued such a law, writes Khalaf.

The religious police who Khalaf refers to the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo (CPVPV), the Saudi authorities who declare that Sharia law is followed. Basically all the articles written about the law, as well in 2014 as in 2011, citing a Motlab Sheikh al Nabet to be a spokesperson for CPVPV.

But Sheikh Motlab al Nabet exists nowhere on the web, in addition to the items on this particular law. And the link that Abdulhadi Khalaf find goes to an article that is published on the Saudi news website Hail News that Abdulhadi Khalaf says is credible ""information relating to the Saudi authorities.""

There CPVPV denies the story of the illegal tempting eyes. The article writes Hail News that ""the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo say they are not issuing any statement which is consistent with yesterday's international spread accusations that they'd begun to crack down on women with glamorous eyes.""

1695,"Hugh Hefner, Founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, was found dead of natural causes Sunday morning at his home, the Playboy Mansion, in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to Los Angeles police officer Jimmy N. Gardner. He was 88.

Police responded to a call around 9 a.m. PDT and confirmed Hefner's identity from other residents of the Playboy Mansion, Gardner said. Police are not releasing a more specific cause of death at this time. ""We'll have to wait for an autopsy report for an official cause of death,"" said Gardner. ""From what I have heard Mr. Hefner was in good health for an 88 year old man. With no signs of foul-play we are left to believe his death was of natural causes.""

Hefner's long publication career first began as a copywriter for Esquire, which was cut short in 1952 after being denied a $5 raise. Less than a year later, after mortgaging his furniture and generating loans from everywhere from banks to even his mother, Hefner launched Playboy. The racy magazine was nearly a hit from its first issue published in December 1953, which featured Marilyn Monroe from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.

However, the Playboy venture wasn't initially all fun and games. On June 4, 1963, Hefner found himself in trouble with the law after being arrested for selling obscene literature after an issue of Playboy featuring nude shots of Jayne Mansfield was released. A jury was unable to reach a verdict.

He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television and has made several movie appearances as himself. In 2009, he received a ""worst supporting actor"" nomination for a Razzie award for his performance in Miss March.

Hefner's death comes as a shock to millions. Despite his older age, the Playboy tycoon was in excellent physical shape.

Hefner was quoted as saying, ""Life is too short to be living someone else's dream."" As a pioneer in the industry, this is a quote he took to heart.

1696,"Apple is reportedly planning to expand its 2015 iPhone lineup to include a new 4-inch model, according to Asian sources [Google Translate] cited by G for Games. The smaller form factor would bring back the ease of one-hand usage that was lost when Apple introduced its larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets. The supply chain sources suggest the new phone may debut in the second half 2015 with female users as the targeted audience for the smaller phone.

Even without a new 4-inch model, Apple's history of product lineups suggests the 4-inch iPhone 5s would remain in the lineup in 2015 as the low-end offering once the current models slide down and the iPhone 5c is presumably discontinued. But if Apple wants to maintain a 4-inch option beyond the 2015 lineup, it would make sense to invest in an updated version of that size as the iPhone 5s ages.

Still, the sourcing on today's rumor is not entirely clear and a track record is unknown, so it is difficult to assess the potential validity of the claim. As a result, we would not put too much stock in it for the time being until or unless additional information surfaces in the coming months.

Even without a new 4-inch model this year, iPhone sales have been strong for the new 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, with Apple setting a new sales record in the first weekend of availability. While the iPhone 6 is outselling the 6 Plus, the larger handset is holding its own in the phablet market, accounting for 41 percent of large-screened smartphone sales in the past three months.

1705,"CAMP EDWARDS - The three Afghanistan National Army officers who went missing during a training exercise at a Cape Cod military base on Saturday were located Monday afternoon near the Canadian border.

CBS Boston reports that the three soldiers were taken into custody early Monday afternoon attempting to cross the Canadian border.

Lt. Col. James Sahady of the Massachusetts National Guard said earlier Monday there were no details to report on the search.

U.S. military officials said the Afghan soldiers had been participating in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise in peacekeeping at Joint Base Cape Cod. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen Saturday at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, an off day for the program.

The soldiers were reporting missing by base security personnel on Saturday night. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

The State Department, Central Command, Massachusetts State Police and local police were involved in a search for the soldiers.

The soldiers, who are in the country on visas, were at the mall at a chaperoned event to introduce them to American culture, according to a CentCom official, when they disappeared.

Pentagon officials told CBS News the officers were not required to surrender their passports, so they could still have them. Local law enforcement officials were given photos of the soldiers.

The Afghan soldiers posed no threat to the public, military officials said.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., wraps up Wednesday. There are about a dozen more Afghan soldiers still participating in the exercise. Military officials from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia are also participants.

Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers who were training with the DEA vanished while on a trip to Washington. The police officers were located in Buffalo.

CBS affiliate WIVB in Buffalo reports the police officer duo told officials they just wanted a better life. They will be returning to Afghanistan.

They had traveled to the U.S. to take part in a long-established training exercise and were not considered to be a threat to the public

The three Afghanistan National Army officers who vanished during a training exercise in Massachusetts on Saturday have reportedly been found trying to cross the border into Canada.

Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar were stopped at the Rainbow Bridge, which spans New York and Ontario near Niagara Falls, on Monday, sources told NBC News.

The men, who were not armed, have been taken into custody.

It is not yet clear how they reached the area after they were last seen at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, Massachusetts on Saturday.

Before they were found Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said that they may have been seeking to defect to the United States.

The trio, who had been reported missing from Joint Base Cape Cod, were not considered a threat to the public, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lieutenant Colonel James Sahady had said.

They had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries.

The men, who were cleared by the US State Department to participate, had been free to 'come and go' when they weren't taking part in exercises, and on Saturday, they had a free day.

'If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,' he told Cape Cod Online.

Disappearing act: Three Afghanistan National Army soldiers had been reported missing from Camp Edwards (pictured) on Saturday after they failed to return following a trip to a nearby mall, officials said

Base authorities, state, and police were involved in the search for the missing soldiers, Sahady said.

Ed Davis, a security analyst, told CBS it was an 'unusual incident and it needs to be checked out'.

'The only cause for concern is the fact that there have been Afghan soldiers who have turned on their United States counterparts and I'm sure that's on most of the minds of the people doing the investigation,' he said.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

Training exercise: The three men were involved in a long-standing training program with participating nations in Massachusetts. Pictured above are other Afghan soldiers following their graduation two weeks ago

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday. There are about a dozen Afghan soldiers still participating in the exercise.

The men, who are all housed at the base, were taking part in a joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies with civilians, officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said.

Military officials from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia - as well as the U.S. - are also at the base as part of the training.

1712,"Apple is said to be close to acquiring social network Path in an attempt to boost the company's social media efforts, reports PandoDaily.

Additionally, Path founder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row for today's special media event, which is usually reserved for high ranking executives at the company. Throughout the past few years, Apple has also featured Path in a number of its earlier advertising campaigns and keynotes for the iPhone.

However, the social networking service caused a fair amount of controversy in 2012 when it was discovered to be uploading users' entire address books to its servers without alerting users or asking for authorization. The issue prompted an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission as Morin was even summoned to Apple's Cupertino headquarters to be grilled by CEO Tim Cook and other executives.

Imgur user Bdawgid says he's the Photoshop wizard behind the altered photo, which was posted to the photo-sharing site on November 27. Bdawgid writes on Imgur that he created the image because, ""it captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation.""

More than 28,000 people shared the faked photo after Jim Gleason, a Maplewood native who's owned a south-county sign business for almost twenty years, posted it on Facebook with the (very incorrect) description: ""You can't make this up!!!!!""

More than 28,000 people shared this doctored photo.
Gleason wouldn't tell Daily RFT what motivated him to share the photo, which refers to the death of Michael Brown, who was recorded on surveillance cameras stealing from a convenience store and was later fatally shot by then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.
""I certainly didn't mean any harm by it,"" Gleason says. He says he found the doctored image on Facebook and took the image down after getting ""an onslaught of emails"" saying it was fake. ""We absolutely, unequivocally did not edit it.""

Riverfront Times reporter Mitch Ryals took the original photo of Hasson, 27, in September in front of the police station.

The original photo.
Hasson told Daily RFT in September he'd been sleeping in a parking lot across the street from the police station for weeks to peacefully protest Brown's death.
""We were literally on this lot for 24 hours for that whole month,"" Hasson told Daily RFT in September. ""I'm not saying here for an hour then going home. Twenty-four [hours] we were in this lot peacefully protesting. We've been rained on for a full week on this lot waiting for the sun to come out in the morning to dry us out.""

This week, Hasson tells Daily RFT he thinks the doctored photo is a sign that Ferguson protests are having an effect on the way people think.

""It shows that we are making a difference out here,"" Hasson says. ""For someone who has nothing better to do with their life than photoshop a sign, it shows me that we haven't been out here since August for no reason. They're trying to stop the movement, which they can't.""

Hasson says he has a message for Gleason and the thousands of people who shared the fake photo: ""Remove the hatred out of your heart, and come and see what we're doing for yourself.""

Gleason says he is surprised and saddened by the backlash to the photo he posted because ""qualified investigators at all levels of government"" concluded that Brown robbed the convenience store before his death.

""It appears that this young man robbed a store, assaulted a police officer, and it is just surprising to me the uprising when the physical evidence seems to be overwhelmingly in support of the police officer's actions,"" Gleason says.

People who objected to the provocative photo posted to the Facebook page for Gleason's business, Sign-A-Rama St. Louis, to warn customers.

""Makes the BEST racist memes on Facebook,"" one person sarcastically wrote on the shop's Facebook page. ""Gives good discounts to whites, charges darkies extra. Highly recommended to any whites in St. Louis looking for a good white pride meme.""

1716,"A Peruvian public service announcement making the rounds today captured two men sexually harassing women on the street, only to find out that the victims of their catcalling are their own moms in disguise. Some sites are treating it as if a prankster's hidden camera actually caught a man hollering at his mom's ""tasty panties,"" but if the scene seems totally staged, that's because it was.

The ""Whistling at Your Mom"" ad actually debuted in Peru back in November, on the heels of the viral ""10 Hours Walking as a Woman in New York City"" that made street harassment a worldwide hot topic. The original Spanish-language video has been viewed more than 5 million times. A reuploaded, translated version hit Reddit this week, bringing the PSA to English-speaking audiences.

When the video first debuted, Spanish newspaper El País reported that the whole scene was staged with actors, but the story was ""based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed female relatives by mistake and expressed 'deep shame.'""

According to internet hoax-busting compendium Emergent.info, Peruvian business newspaper Gestion also called the video out as a scripted setup, writing, ""Speaking about the narrative aspect, it is obvious the situations had been staged. We do understand it would be difficult to go with real interactions, but it is also obvious they wanted us to believe they were real, when they're not.""

It's basically a funnier, tamer version of the hoax video from last November that showed men on Hollywood Boulevard trying to take advantage of a ""drunk"" woman. At least the actors knew what they were getting into in this one.

1717,"A 17-year-old transgender teenage girl in Ohio has died by what appears to have been suicide, leaving behind a Tumblr note that blames her parents for not accepting her gender identity, isolating her, and forcing her to attend faith-based therapy. ""There's no winning,"" the note reads, in part. ""There's no way out.""

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan Alcorn, was walking along Interstate 71 when she was hit and killed by a semi-truck around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Sunday, December 28. The local news accounts refer to Alcorn as male, but she blogged frequently on a Tumblr called ""Lazer Princess"" about living as a trans teen. Judging by the Tumblr, she was a fan of Sailor Moon, feminism, and stockings with cats on them; she regularly re-blogged inspirational photos of trans adults.

It's also where she published a post titled ""Suicide Note,"" which she had pre-scheduled before her death. From the beginning of the note:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don't be sad, it's for the better. The life I would've lived isn't worth living in… because I'm transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally ""boyish"" things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.
Alcorn apparently believed she'd never be able to transition successfully. She concludes:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.
On Facebook, Alcorn's mother has written, ""My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck."" The message has been shared repeatedly by people who are upset that she is misgendering her child.

This is gut-wrenching, and it was avoidable. On Twitter, trans activists are mourning Leelah:

1719,"Bah, humbug!

A passenger was tossed off a plane at La Guardia Airport on Tuesday after flipping out — because airline workers wished him a merry Christmas.

The man was waiting to board American Airlines Flight 1140 to Dallas when a cheerful gate agent began welcoming everyone with the Yuletide greeting while checking boarding passes.

The grumpy passenger, who appeared to be traveling alone, barked at the woman, “You shouldn’t say that because not everyone celebrates Christmas.”

The agent replied, “Well, what should I say then?”

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man shouted before brushing past her.

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a “merry Christmas.” That was the last straw.

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

The crew tried to calm the unidentified man, but he refused to back down and continued hectoring them.

He was escorted off the plane as other fliers burst into cheers and applause.

1723,"Apple is taking the security of its new Apple Watches seriously.

According to a report from 9to5Mac, the Cupertino company is installing custom-made safes in its Apple Stores for storing the high-end 18k gold Apple Watches.

Some of the safes are already in place, and come with MagSafe chargers inside them to ensure the watches remain charged at all times. They'll ""likely be used to carry both to-be-sold inventory as well as to store demo units from the show floor overnight,"" the tech blog reports.

Apple is also working on special weight scales for measuring the Apple Watch. This is to stop customers buying the device, secretly removing or replacing the gold, and then returning it to the store after selling the precious metal on.

So how much is the 18K gold Apple watch retailing for? It's not yet confirmed, but rumours peg the price point at somewhere between $1,200 and $5,000. The regular models are a bargain in comparison, starting at just $349.

According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, we should expect to see an Apple Watch launch at some point in April — though tester models are already being spotted in the wild.

Here's a promotional photo of the gold model:

1727,"Apple Watch will take approximately two hours to fully charge and deliver all-day battery life with normal on-and-off usage, according to TechCrunch. Those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the Apple Watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge.

The report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.""Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.""Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a ""weightier, higher-end feel."" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.

While both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated ""Spring Forward"" media event in San Francisco. The keynote begins on Monday at 10 AM Pacific and MacRumors will be providing live coverage of the event.

1729,"The families of murdered American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff are speaking out against the US government for making their efforts to free their loved ones a ""helpless"" endeavor.

The parents of Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who was kidnapped by militants in Syria, told Yahoo News on Friday that a member of the president's National Security Council threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to pay a ransom to get their son freed.

""The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this,"" Barak Barfi, a friend of Sotloff who is serving as a spokesman for his family, told Yahoo News. ""The Sotloffs felt there was nothing they could do to get Steve out.""

Sotloff's mother, Shirley, recorded an emotional video directly addressing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late August. Despite her plea for mercy, the group murdered her son one week later.

The claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foley's mother Diane, in which she said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by the US government's handling of her son's case.

In the interview, Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do, including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal — ""we might be prosecuted,"" Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him.

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" she said. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

Jim Foley, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria, was brutally murdered in mid-August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.

""It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted ... "" Diane Foley told ABC News. ""I’m sure [the US official] didn’t mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing … meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.”

The US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley, Sotloff, and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, although the special operations troops were unable to locate any of them. The Wall Street Journal reported the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid.",family murdered american journalist jim foley steven sotloff speaking u government making effort free loved one helpless endeavor parent steven sotloff freelance journalist kidnapped militant syria told yahoo news friday member president national security council threatened criminal prosecution attempted pay ransom get son freed family felt completely utterly helpless heard barak barfi friend sotloff serving spokesman family told yahoo news sotloffs felt nothing could get steve sotloff mother shirley recorded emotional video directly addressing isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi late august despite plea mercy group murdered son one week later claim government would bring charge sotloff family echo similar point made cnn interview jim foley mother diane said embarrassed appalled u government handling son case interview diane foley listed thing u government advised family including going medium raise ransom since would illegal might prosecuted foley said told also say government told would exchange prisoner conduct military action go told trust would freed somehow miraculously said jim foley freelance journalist working globalpost syria brutally murdered mid august soon u began airstrikes isi militant iraq made realize people talking u idea like family someone abducted diane foley told abc news sure u official mean way said rock hard place told could nothing meanwhile son beaten tortured every day u military attempted rescue operation july find foley sotloff hostage believed held near isi de facto capital raqqa syria although special operation troop unable locate wall street journal reported hostage likely moved little hour prior raid,jim foley steven sotloff speaking u government making effort free loved one helpless endeavor parent steven sotloff freelance journalist kidnapped militant syria told yahoo news friday member president national security council threatened criminal prosecution attempted pay ransom get son freed family felt completely helpless heard diane foley listed thing u government advised family including going medium raise ransom since would illegal might prosecuted foley said also say government told exchange prisoner conduct military action
1736,"IBM may be set to announce big layoffs this week.

IBM (IBM) shares were higher in early trading on unconfirmed reports that it’s getting set to slash 26% of its workforce, or nearly 112,000 jobs as part of reorganization plan dubbed ""Project Chrome.""  The massive jobs cuts would be the biggest in IBM's history and comes after the company reported its 11th straight quarter of declining revenue.  However, CNBC Jon Fortt is reporting that the number of layoffs could be much smaller, in the range of 10,000 or less.

Yahoo Finance reached out to IBM and they sent us this statement:

""IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones.  If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing.

Last year, IBM hired 45,000 people, and the company currently has about 15,000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies.

1741,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable.

1748,"The female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance before allegedly being beheaded by Islamic State militants is actually alive and well, it was claimed today.

The woman, known by the pseudonym Rehana, was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the besieged Syrian border city after an image of her making a peace sign was retweeted over 5,000 times.

That picture was followed days later by a gruesome photograph of an ISIS terrorist holding the severed head of a young woman, sparking rumours that Rehana had been savagely murdered.

But now friends of Rehana have told MailOnline that the dead woman in the photograph is in fact a different Kurdish resistance fighter, adding that Rehana managed to escape Kobane during intense fighting there last week and is now believed to be living in southern Turkey.

A huge cloud of smoke is seen following an American airstrike in the Syrian town of Kobane this morning

Speaking of ISIS' sickening propaganda photograph, a journalist who was based in Kobane as recently as last week said the dead woman is not Rehana but another Kurdish resistance fighter.

'She is my friend and I confirm that she is alive. And the picture of beheaded female fighter is not Rehana's picture,' he told MailOnline, speaking on condition of anonymity.

He went on to say that he saw Rehana leave Kobane during intense fighting there last week, shortly before he was forced to do the same thing.

Although he lost temporarily lost contact with Rehana as they made their separate journeys over the nearby Turkish border, the journalist said he has been informed by friends that she is living as a refugee in Turkey, most likely in the southern Şanliurfa Province.

'She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost the connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes Rehana left Kobane,' he said.

MailOnline also spoke to another friend of Rehana's who confirmed the dead woman in the sickening ISIS photograph was not Rehana, who she described as 'the daughter of a martyr'.

'The facial features [of the head in the ISIS photo] are not hers,' she said, refusing to give her name.

However the friend claimed she was not with Rehana, had not seen her since the time the photograph emerged, and no longer had any way of contacting her.

'I can give news on her, but I don't want to talk until I get someone's advice... A person in Kobane has refuted this news [that she is dead], and I'm going to speak to him again tomorrow,' the friend said.

'Everyone's asking about her, using her. And I don't want to talk about her,' she went on to say.

The friends' claims that Rehana is still alive was reinforced by others who says they know Rehana and have spoken to her in recent days.

Among those claiming to have communicated with Rehana is the Syrian/Kurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader.

Qader said rumours that she had singlehandedly killed 100 ISIS fighters inside Kobane were untrue, but claimed she was still 'fighting fiercely'.

The suggestion Rehana may still be alive was first raised by the Swedish freelance journalist Carl Drott, who said he had met her during a ceremony in which the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, was first set up in Kobane.

He said the dead woman in the ISIS photograph may initially look like Rehana, but on closer inspection her facial features and hair style and colour betrayed subtle differences.

He also said that as Rehana had left a law degree in Aleppo to fight join the fight in her hometown Kobane, she hadn't received the level of training required to become a full member of the YPJ and so worked as a reservist, providing support to those on the frontline.

Such claims might it highly unlikely she would have been able to singlehandedly kill 100 ISIS fighters, as per the rumours that spread when the photograph of her making the peace sign first emerged.

Syrian Kurds gather in the Turkish town of Suruc for the funeral of Kurdish fighters killed by ISIS in Kobane

The news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive came as Kurdish resistance fighters continue to push the Islamic State back in Kobane.

Among those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood. In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women.

These female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region.

The Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary.

One Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher.

Now, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town.

The 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria.

'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?'

The funeral for three Kurdish fighters who died fighting ISIS in Kobane was held in Suruc, Turkey last week

After more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.'

There is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

The campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey.

Suicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory.

Early this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces.

Haj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in.

Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported ISIS militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women

Surrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday.

Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women, captured in clashes near Turkish border.

The news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive comes as militants from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front attacked the government-held Syrian city of Idlib, killing dozens of soldiers loyal to the regime and temporarily taking control of a number of buildings.

The militants were later pushed back into the outskirts of the city, which has been held by the government after being briefly seized by rebel forces in 2012.

British ISIS hostage John Cantlie has been used as a news reporter from the battle-ravaged city of Kobane in a slickly-produced new video released by the insurgents.

The photojournalist, who was captured last year while working in Syria, is seen addressing the camera in the propaganda video as he walks around what he claims is the city.

In the news broadcast-style footage, entitled Inside 'Ayn-Islam, Mr Cantlie appears to be reading from a prepared script as he says that despite reports coming from the west, the city is still in the hands of the insurgents, who he refers to as the mujahideen.

The clip opens with an aerial shot, purportedly of the city, which is said to have been filmed using a drone, before Mr Cantlie begins his report.

The 'drone of the Islamic State Army' shows a deserted city accompanied by the sound of sporadic gun fire.

Dressed in a loose-fitting black shirt, his hair slightly longer than in other videos released by the extremist group, Mr Cantlie appears to be in good health as he addresses the camera in the five-and-a-half minute broadcast.

His beard also appears longer, with a few jihadists on social media suggesting that Cantlie might be on the verge of converting to Islam.

He starts the report by saying: 'Hello, I'm John Cantlie and today we are in the city of Kobane on the Syrian-Turkish border.'

Breaking off to point out Turkey 'right behind' him, he says he is speaking from the zone said to be controlled by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is battling IS fighters.

1749,"Apple will reportedly be following a few best-practices from traditional jewelry stores when safe-guarding its gold “Edition” Apple Watch models from theft. Apple is planning on several safeguards for their high-end watch models, including a custom safe that will be fitted with Apple Watch MagSafe chargers to keep the demo units charged and ready to go.

Apple Stores to Keep Gold Apple Watches in Custom Safes

9to5Mac:

The safes will likely be used to carry both to-be-sold inventory as well as to store demo units from the show floor overnight. The custom-designed safes will be outfitted with Apple Watch MagSafe chargers in order to keep the demo units charged up and ready to go for the next day of business. Apple has already begun installing the safes in some stores ahead of the Apple Watch’s expected release in April…

In addition to the safes, Apple is also said to be working on ways to allow customers to try on Apple Watches, as well as try different color options and band materials.

9to5Mac also reports that Apple is working on special scales to weigh the amount of gold in each Apple Watch Edition wearable, in order to weigh the amount of gold in the watch upon replacement of return. This will ensure no gold has been removed from the device prior to a return. The gold material is worth a pretty penny in secondary markets.

While we know pricing for the aluminum and glass Apple Watch will start at $349, no official pricing has been announced for the more expensive stainless steel and gold variants. The weighing process does indicate however, that the highest priced variant will carry a substantial amount of gold in it, indicating the price of the device will be quite dear.",apple reportedly following best practice traditional jewelry store safe guarding gold edition apple watch model theft apple planning several safeguard high end watch model including custom safe fitted apple watch magsafe charger keep demo unit charged ready go apple store keep gold apple watch custom safe mac safe likely used carry sold inventory well store demo unit show floor overnight custom designed safe outfitted apple watch magsafe charger order keep demo unit charged ready go next day business apple already begun installing safe store ahead apple watch expected release april addition safe apple also said working way allow customer try apple watch well try different color option band material mac also report apple working special scale weigh amount gold apple watch edition wearable order weigh amount gold watch upon replacement return ensure gold removed device prior return gold material worth pretty penny secondary market know pricing aluminum glass apple watch start official pricing announced expensive stainless steel gold variant weighing process indicate however highest priced variant carry substantial amount gold indicating price device quite dear,apple watch apple watch apple watch apple watch apple watch start official pricing announced expensive stainless steel gold variant carry substantial amount gold indicating price device quite dear apple watch model theft apple planning several safeguard high end watch model including custom safe fitted apple watch magsafe charger keep demo unit charged ready go next day business apple already begun installing safe store ahead apple watch expected release april addition safe apple also said working way allow customer try apple watch well try different color option band material mac also report apple working special scale weigh amount gold apple watch edition wearable

The three soldiers had been in the United States for 11 days for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod and were last seen at a shopping mall in Hyannis, Massachusetts during a day off according to NBC News.

The three Afghan National Army soldiers were taking part in a joint training program between Afghanistan and the United States.

Massachusetts State Police Col. Timothy Alben told the American news channel “there’s no reason to think [the soldiers] have nefarious intent.”

He added there’s no information suggestion public safety was at risk.

1755,"The doctor - named as Dr. Gwen Korovin - refused to comment when cameras approached her today, but has reportedly told friends it's false

The doctor who reportedly took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia has denied she ever took the photo, according to reports.

The woman, who has been identified as Dr. Gwen Korovin according to TMZ , refused to comment when photographers spotted her heading to work in New York a matter of hours ago - but friends now insist it's ""lies"".

According to TMZ, Dr Korovin also told friends she never performed a biopsy, as has been claimed, and added CNN's source - who originally broke the story about the selfie - is ""making up lies"".

But sources were unable to say if the doctor performed any other procedure.

It comes shortly after she was spotted rushing past photographers today, refusing to comment when asked about the claims (see video below).

Dr Korovin wouldn't look at the camera when she was asked to comment in New York, and walked straight inside despite photographers shouting questions about the procedure and alleged selfie.

Arriving at work with a companion to protect her from cameras, the doctor hid behind huge sunglasses as she was ushered inside.

It’s thought Dr Gwen, who is an ear, nose and throat doctor to the stars, was working as Joan’s personal doctor when she attended the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 to undergo a routine procedure.

Mirror Celeb have contacted for comment.

On Wednesday it was claimed that the doctor, now believed to be Gwen, took a selfie with the star while she was under anaesthesia.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that could have led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

The clinic have made it very clear that they did not perform the alleged biopsy or put the comedienne under anaesthesia.

Following Joan’s death Dr. Lawrence - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic – resigned from his position.

And it seems it’s not her first time in the limelight – she previously appeared in a Celine Dion documentary.

A clip from Celine’s 2010 documentary Through the Eyes of the World , obtained by TMZ, shows Dr Gwen interacting with the world famous singer.

The doctor, whose offices are on East 77th Street, New York, has previously worked with Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Hugh Jackman.

Her office walls are believed to be lined with pictures of the famous people she has looked after over the years.

1759,"A new law in Saudi Arabia banning ‘tempting eyes’ has become the latest example of female oppression in the country.

The law, which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil, has been branded ‘stupid’ by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media, aina.org reports.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, said they ‘had the right’ to force women to cover their face.

‘The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones,’ he said.

‘We have the right to do so.’

Many commentators wondered how the word ‘tempting’ would be applied.

One unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to ‘uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup.’

‘Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble,’ they added.

Prince Naif, whose impending ascension to the Saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression, looks likely to be as intolerant as his father King Abdullah after suggesting that any Muslim should support the Committee’s new law.

It appears Saudi markets are back in play. As Bloomberg's Richard Breslow noted this morning, Riyal forwards have jerked notably higher (implying weakness expected) and the Tadawul All Share Index has dropped 7% in the last 2 days after the killing of Shi'ites by unknown parties and now news that a pipeline has exploded. As Breslow warns, ""if that indeed signifies the spread of Islamic State into Saudi Arabia, it would be the first time they crossed Saudi borders. That would be a big deal and a major escalation of problems over in that part of the world, far beyond what it would do to capital markets.""

Yesterday there were attacks on Shi'ites (as Reuters reported)

Saudi security forces on Tuesday shot dead a member of an armed group that killed five people in an overnight attack on Shi'ite Muslims marking an important religious anniversary, al-Arabiya television reported.

The late Monday assault on a Shi'ite gathering in al-Ahsa district is likely to test already strained relations between Sunnis and Shi'ites across the Middle East because it coincided with the annual Ashoura commemoration of Shi'ite Islam.

The Dubai-based al-Arabiya said security forces who had been hunting suspects in the al-Ahsa attack clashed with and killed ""a wanted man"" at a rest area in the al-Qassim province, north-west of the capital Riyadh.
... and today, what is allegedly an Aramco pipeline, just exploded near the town of Sudair, south of Riyadh.

As OilPro adds, two other discussions are going around trading desks:

This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production.
The US Elections are over, time for prices at the pump to go back up now.

1765,"A five-year-old has been handed an invoice and his parents threatened with court action - for missing his friend's birthday party.

Derek Nash and his partner Tanya Walsh discovered the £15.95 ""no show fee"" invoice after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

Mr Nash said he originally ""thought it was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved with the birthday boy's mother, Julie Lawrence, threatening small claims court.

His partner confronted Ms Lawrence in a series of posts on Facebook in a bid to resolve the situation.

The family confirmed their son would be attending the party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre just before the Christmas holidays.

However, Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but the family were shocked to receive the bill just over a week later.

Mr Nash added: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

""I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her. She said, 'Yes, a brown envelope'.

""I then visited Alex's school head teacher, who couldn't apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on. She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.

""I left the school and went to see [the birthday boy's mother] as her address was on the invoice. When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my son's school bag and that I wasn't happy about it.

""I told her I would not be paying her the money. I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son's school bag.

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

Ms Lawrence has since threatened the family that she would take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Mr Nash added: ""I drive all around the south west for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this. They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.""

Ms Lawrence said the boy's non-attendance left her out of pocket and insisted his parents did have details to tell her he was not going.

1767,"Eight to go! Bart's owners accepted their loss after he was hit by car and buried him in his Tampa backyard, but it appears the tough feline survived despite severe head trauma, a broken jaw and a dead eye.

A Florida cat written off for dead after being hit by a car stunned its owner by digging its way out of his grave so he could be fed, it's claimed.

Ellis Huston thought he'd said his final goodbyes to beloved kittie Bart when he buried him in his Tampa backyard shortly after he was knocked down by a vehicle, according to FOX 13.

But he was left flabbergasted when, several days later, the injured but very alive mog wound up outside his home.

The gutsy pet had severe trauma to his head, a broken jaw and a dead eye. But he still begged for food.

Bart was rushed to the vets, where medics said he would likely lose an eye but would hopefully survive.

Huston said he was startled by the feline's apparent return from the dead.

Rescuers at the Tampa Bay Humane Society, where he is currently being treated, believed he may have regained consciousness shortly after being buried, reports FOX 13.

They think he clawed his way out of the ground before hiding for several days before mustering up the courage to go home.

1768,"An angry bride in India married a guest at her wedding after the original groom fell ill during the nuptials.

Jugal Kishore, the 25-year-old groom from Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh and 23-year-old Indira were about to perform the ritual exchange of garlands at their wedding ceremony when the groom suffered an epileptic fit, the Times of India reported.

Kishore fell to the ground and was soon rushed to a nearby hospital.

The unexpected event enraged the bride who felt cheated that the groom and his family had concealed Kishore's health issues from her, and prompted her to dump him on the spot.

She declared she would marry any person among the guests, who was willing to accept her as his wife.

A man from the gathering quickly obliged and the couple exchanged garlands and completed the rituals necessary to officially become husband and wife.

However, the high voltage wedding drama did not end there.

The groom who had fallen ill came back from hospital only to find his would-be-wife had become another man's better half.

He tried convincing the young woman to marry him, even pleading he would not be able to face friends or family if she refused.

The situation soon escalated into a major fight between the two parties, which could only be resolved after the intervention of the police and elders.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" the local police head RP Solanki told the Times of India.

""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.""

1770,"Apparently Las Vegas isn't the only city on the National Hockey League's expansion team radar: Seattle, Toronto and Quebec City will add franchises as well with a target date of 2017, according to a tweet from SportsBusinessNews' Howard Bloom.

Bloom said the four-fold expansion, which would increase the number of NHL teams to 34 and the number of Canadian team to nine, could raise $1.4 billion in expansion fees.

A report Tuesday in Canada's The Province revealed the finalization of an NHL franchise in Las Vegas, with only the new team's ownership left to determine. The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports league's for the first time in the city's history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the city's potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry.
On Wednesday morning, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas.

Seattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015. A new team in Toronto would mean a second franchise for the city. The Maple Leafs are the NHL's highest grossing and most valuable franchise by net worth.

1773,"Argentinean President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner officially became the godmother of a Jewish boy last Tuesday.

But the reasons behind the ceremonial act have gotten blurred with folklore about werewolves in South America.

It was reported that the adoption was connected to an ancient legend or myth where the seventh son born after six boys becomes a werewolf. Turns out, there's a custom involving Argentina's President taking god children, and a myth about werewolves, and other than involving seventh sons, they are unrelated, according to a report in the Guardian Monday.

According to Argentinian custom, the country's president takes the seventh child of Argentine families as a godchild. The honor only applied to Catholic children before 2009. According to reports, Kirchner took Yair Tawil as a godson after his parents were initially denied in their request in 1993. He appealed and last week became the first Jewish god son of the country's president.

Earlier reports, including one in UPI, explained that according to Argentinian legend, the seventh son in a daughter-less family will turn into a werewolf (""el lobison"") on his 13th birthday.

""The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons,"" the UPI story stated. ""To counteract this stigma, the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson.""

But Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the Guardian that the two traditions aren't actually linked.

""The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" he explained.

According to Balmaceda, the later custom was actually started in the early 1900s by German and Russian emigres who brought the tradition to Argentina from Europe. The custom became official law in 1974, unrelated to werewolves.

Here's one of de Kirchner's tweets from last week's ceremony:",argentinean president cristina fern ndez de kirchner officially became godmother jewish boy last tuesday reason behind ceremonial act gotten blurred folklore werewolf south america reported adoption connected ancient legend myth seventh son born six boy becomes werewolf turn custom involving argentina president taking god child myth werewolf involving seventh son unrelated according report guardian monday according argentinian custom country president take seventh child argentine family godchild honor applied catholic child according report kirchner took yair tawil godson parent initially denied request appealed last week became first jewish god son country president earlier report including one upi explained according argentinian legend seventh son daughter le family turn werewolf el lobison th birthday legend became feared family would abandon kill son upi story stated counteract stigma president argentina began adopt one boy godson argentine historian daniel balmaceda told guardian two tradition actually linked local myth lobiz n way connected custom began year ago every seventh son seventh daughter born argentina becomes godchild president explained according balmaceda later custom actually started early german russian emigre brought tradition argentina europe custom became official law unrelated werewolf one de kirchner tweet last week ceremony,president cristina fern ndez de kirchner officially became godmother jewish boy last tuesday reason behind ceremonial act gotten blurred folklore werewolf south america reported adoption connected ancient legend myth seventh son born six boy becomes werewolf turn custom involving argentina president taking god child myth werewolf involving seventh son unrelated according to guardian monday . custom actually started early german russian emigre brought tradition argentina europe custom became
1779,"Apple could be planning to introduce the much-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air during its March 9 Apple Watch event, according to one site that claims to have sources within Apple. The Michael Report believes Apple will use the event to debut the ultrathin MacBook, which is rumored to have a Retina display and a redesigned chassis.Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.While there have been no concrete rumors from major sites linking the Retina MacBook Air to Apple's March 9 event, previous rumors have indicated that Apple is planning for a spring release. Apple supplier Quanta is said to have begun mass production of the notebook in January, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted a March launch for the MacBook.

Rendering of the 12-inch Retina MacBook Air created by Martin Hajek
When taking these rumors into account, along with the fact that the MacBook Air is due for an update, the introduction of the Retina MacBook Air at Apple's March 9 event does seem like a possibility. It's also possible Apple will introduce new models of the existing 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air at the event -- the last update was in April and there was a rumor suggesting an update in February was imminent. Core M Broadwell chips believed to be appropriate for the 12-inch Retina MacBook have been available since November, and chips appropriate for the standard MacBook Air began shipping in January.

Along with a Retina display, the 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to come without a fan assembly for silent operation, made possible by the aforementioned Core M chips, and it may also include a revamped trackpad that does not incorporate a mechanical button. It is said to feature smaller bezels in a Retina MacBook Pro-style black, a keyboard that stretches right to the edges of the machine, and speakers that are located above the keyboard.

The Michael Report has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors. The site accurately predicted some design elements of the iPad Air 2, but its predictions may have been based on dummy models that were circulating around the Internet at the time. The site also shared details on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus ahead of their launch, inaccurately calling the iPhone 6 Plus the ""iPhone 6L"" and suggesting the iPhones would come with quad-core processors and sapphire displays.

More details about what Apple plans to unveil at its Monday, March 9 event may come out through the week. Thus far, many sites have agreed that the focal point of the event will be the Apple Watch, with Apple unveiling new details about the device like its price and its official launch date.

1782,"POLICE are investigating claims a doctor took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was unconscious on the operating table, before performing a biopsy she hadn’t consented to.

The shocking claim was made by a staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, where Rivers underwent a routine throat procedure on August 28.

After complications, the 81-year-old comedian was rushed to hospital where she died a week later.

SHOCK LOSS: Joan Rivers dead at 81

Investigators are looking in to claims that a second unnamed doctor entered the operating room after that initial procedure to conduct a biopsy on her vocal chords.

They are also probing claims by the staff member that the clinician who performed the biopsy first snapped a photo of himself with the sedated star.

CNN cited a source close to the investigation as saying that the vocal chord biopsy was not something Rivers had consented to.

That same source also said investigators believe Rivers could have suffered a heart attack after her throat began to swell during the biopsy, depriving her of oxygen.

1792,"While Apple's iPhone 6 has only been out in the market for four months, there are already rumors regarding the upcoming iPhone 6S.

The iPhone 6S will not be released until over half a year from now, but rumors out of Taiwan are suggesting that Apple is considering a dual-lens system for the smartphone's camera, according to website UDN, citing sources from Apple's supply chain in Asia.

In addition, ""Force Touch,"" the pressure-sensitive touch system technology which will be launched with the release of the Apple Watch, could also be included in the iPhone 6S.

The transition into a dual-lens system for the iPhone 6S's camera will allow Apple to include an optical zoom feature on their flagship smartphone for the first time. The camera module of the iPhone 6S, which will likely undergo a redesign, will also lead to improvements in the low-light photo capture performance for the smartphone by allowing additional light to enter the camera's sensor.

Apple has been making sizeable investments in the company's imaging technology, counting the camera of the iPhone as one of its most marketable assets. As such, the camera of the iPhone is a possible area of interest for upgrades to be made in the future.

The camera sensor in the iPhone 6 Plus, which was supplied to Apple by Sony, includes features such as optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus. As such, the camera of the iPhone 6 Plus has received praise from experts as the ""best smartphone camera ever made,"" rivaling even the quality of many current models of point-and-shoot cameras.

In addition to the rumors regarding the camera of the iPhone 6S, TPK, a touch module supplier based in Taiwan, is said to be a possible supplier of three-dimensional touch sensors for the smartphone. These sensors will bring Force Touch technology to the iPhone 6S, a feature that will be introduced in the upcoming wearable device Apple Watch.

For the Apple Watch, Force Touch will allow the device to detect the amount of pressure applied by the user in touch commands, which will then translate to different input commands. For example, users pressing heavily on the device's screen can bring up a list of options, and a light press on the screen can then select one of those options. Such a feature could prove to be useful in the iPhone 6S.

UDN also thinks that the feature will be included in the smartphone to lead to higher accuracy in the reading of the pulse and blood pressure of the user as an additional input sensor for Apple's HealthKit system.",apple iphone market four month already rumor regarding upcoming iphone iphone released half year rumor taiwan suggesting apple considering dual lens system smartphone camera according website udn citing source apple supply chain asia addition force touch pressure sensitive touch system technology launched release apple watch could also included iphone transition dual lens system iphone camera allow apple include optical zoom feature flagship smartphone first time camera module iphone likely undergo redesign also lead improvement low light photo capture performance smartphone allowing additional light enter camera sensor apple making sizeable investment company imaging technology counting camera iphone one marketable asset camera iphone possible area interest upgrade made future camera sensor iphone plus supplied apple sony includes feature optical image stabilization phase detection autofocus camera iphone plus received praise expert best smartphone camera ever made rivaling even quality many current model point shoot camera addition rumor regarding camera iphone tpk touch module supplier based taiwan said possible supplier three dimensional touch sensor smartphone sensor bring force touch technology iphone feature introduced upcoming wearable device apple watch apple watch force touch allow device detect amount pressure applied user touch command translate different input command example user pressing heavily device screen bring list option light press screen select one option feature could prove useful iphone udn also think feature included smartphone lead higher accuracy reading pulse blood pressure user additional input sensor apple healthkit system,user pressing heavily device screen bring list option light press screen select one option feature could prove useful iphone udn also think feature included smartphone lead higher accuracy reading pulse blood pressure user additional input sensor apple healthkit system .
1793,"Hewlett-Packard is officially splitting in two. Following rumors over the weekend, HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation, and continue as CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler, an executive at HP’s PC business, will take over as CEO of the company’s PC and printer operation.

HP Enterprise is the newly split-off part of the original company, and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers. ""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" says HP CEO Meg Whitman. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders."" HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015, and the structure will mean the company's total planned layoffs will rise to 55,000 from an earlier estimate of 45,000 to 50,000 cuts.

Today’s split is a significant change for the company, following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time. Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO, just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct. Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy, and failed to capitalize on the company’s purchase of webOS.

Whitman’s era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry, leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide. Whitman’s initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was ""too complex and too slow,"" noting it had underinvested in its PC division. Instead of significant investment, Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone, before failing to announce one in 2013. Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the company’s consumer PC business in 2013, but it never happened. HP has recently focused on Android tablets, and even an Android laptop, after describing Microsoft as an ""outright competitor.""

HP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low-cost Stream PCs. Although Lenovo continues to push Windows-based PCs, Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a $2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year. That particular deal may have angered HP, but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season. HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall.

A new HP says it will focus on ""new computing experiences"" and technologies like 3D printing. ""As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before,"" says Dion Weisler, head of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business.",hewlett packard officially splitting two following rumor weekend hp announcing today separate pc printer division enterprise service business split mean current ceo meg whitman become chairman pc printer operation continue ceo split enterprise business dion weisler executive hp pc business take ceo company pc printer operation hp enterprise newly split part original company hp inc continue focus pc printer decision separate two market leading company underscore commitment turnaround plan say hp ceo meg whitman provide new company independence focus financial resource flexibility need adapt quickly market customer dynamic generating long term value shareholder hp planning complete split end fiscal structure mean company total planned layoff rise earlier estimate cut today split significant change company following rumor hp considering similar split time report surfaced shortly hp appointed meg witman ceo month former ceo leo apotheker took mark hurd forced resign amidst charge inappropriate business conduct apotheker spearheaded disastrous acquisition autonomy failed capitalize company purchase webos whitman era hp seen company struggle cement solid position industry leaving lenovo dominate pc sale worldwide whitman initial assessment company around six month left feeling complex slow noting underinvested pc division instead significant investment whitman claimed company offer smartphone failing announce one board member reportedly mulled spinning company consumer pc business never happened hp recently focused android tablet even android laptop describing microsoft outright competitor hp microsoft appear forming closer relationship launch new low cost stream pc although lenovo continues push window based pc microsoft still need close pc ally demonstrated billion loan help dell go private last year particular deal may angered hp renewed partnership see microsoft hp take chromebooks holiday season hp also planning sell smartwatch fall new hp say focus new computing experience technology like printing market leader printing personal system independent hp inc extremely well positioned deliver innovation across traditional market well extend leadership new market like printing new computing experience inventing technology empowers people create interact inspire like never say dion weisler head hp printing personal system business,rumor hp considering similar split time report surfaced shortly hp appointed meg witman ceo month former ceo leo apotheker took mark hurd forced resign amidst charge inappropriate business conduct hp announcing today separate pc printer division enterprise service business split mean current ceo meg whitman become chairman pc printer operation continue ceo split enterprise business dion weisler executive hp pc business take ceo company pc printer

1801,"Oil futures extended gains Wednesday on unconfirmed rumors of an oil pipeline explosion in Saudi Arabia after previously spiking on data that showed U.S. crude inventories rose less than expected.

U.S. crude stocks increased by 460,000 barrels in the last week, data from the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Analysts had expected a rise of 2.2 million barrels.

Brent turned positive, popping 61 cents to $83.43 a barrel shortly after the report was released. It previously reached a low of $81.63 for the day, its weakest level since late 2010.

U.S. crude rose $1.37 to $78.56 a barrel, rebounding off a low of $75.84 hit in the previous session, its weakest since October 2011.

Earlier on Wednesday weak economic data from top energy consumer China intensified worries about demand as a global supply glut grows.

Services sector growth in China weakened in October as new business cooled, a private survey showed, coming just days after data revealed sluggish factory growth in the world's second-largest economy.

""Supply is higher and demand expectations are being cut almost every day,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam.

Brazil's oil output reached a record 2.358 million barrels per day in September, up nearly 13 percent from a year earlier, national oil regulator ANP said on Tuesday.

Consistent supply from Libya and Iraq, where many expected production to be disrupted by conflict, has added to the downward pressure on prices.

Van Cleef added that dollar strength was weighing on oil. Oil, priced in dollars, becomes more expensive to holders of other currencies when the U.S. currency rises, denting demand.

The dollar index hit a new 4-1/2-year high on Wednesday.

Oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic lost more than 2 percent on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia cut export prices to the United States, threatening to deepen a global supply glut that has driven crude prices down 30 percent since June.

A bleak outlook for Europe after the European Commission downgraded its forecast for euro zone economic growth over the next few years also weighed on oil prices.

Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi is making his first visits in years to fellow exporters Venezuela and Mexico, although tumbling oil prices are not the stated purpose of the trip, according to officials and sources.

Still, the travel plans come at a pivotal moment for Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets later in November to discuss how to respond to the rout in global oil prices.

1809,"The Commissioner of the National Hockey League, Gary Bettman, has repeatedly insisted that the league is not engaged in an active ""expansion process,"" but reports insisting otherwise continue to crop up.

The latest is from veteran Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher, who suggested on Tuesday that the NHL will expand to Las Vegas, Nev. sooner rather than later:

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

Gallagher also insists that there's fire behind all of the NHL-related smoke emanating out of Seattle, Wash. and reports that Vancouver-born billionaire Victor Coleman would be among the bidders interested in bringing a second NHL club to the Pacific Northwest.

While rumors about Las Vegas expansion continue to swirl, to the consternation of players like Chicago Blackhawks nofunnick Jonathan Toews, NHL brass has been steadfast in their insistence that nothing is imminent for the league on the expansion front.

""We're not ready to expand,"" Bettman said in early May, addressing rumors of potential NHL expansion in Las Vegas. ""We, as I repeatedly have said, have received expressions of interest from people who might want to own a franchise in Las Vegas - as we have from a number of other cities - but we're not involved in any expansion process.""

1810,"We can already hear the nostalgic sigh.

The new original, published January 20, headlined high : ""Attention, children of the 1990s: you can always pick up the McDonald's pizza."" This was followed by a buzz on the web (38 000 shares on Facebook), both by nostalgia craze for this dish fast food now gone.

For our younger readers, the mega-chain of fast McRestauration had begun to use the McPizza in its McRestaurants (ok, ok, we stop that) in the 1980s In 1991, the McPizza was entering some 500 restaurants, including Quebec. Finally, McDonald's drops the McPizza the early 2000s, as his 11-minute cooking time is considered too long.

But now the site canada.com tells us that two McDonald's restaurants still serve the McPizza in Pomeroy, Ohio and Spencer, WV (West Virginia), not THAT far from the Canadian border in search for intrepid frozen pizza-warmed.

But, hey, the inspector must break your hearts: this is wrong .

How do viral inspector was able to deny the news, while several media did move ?

Here's how he conducted his investigation top secret, so strong in its labyrinthine twists qu'ahurissante intrigues: he called the headquarters of McDonald's.

It's as simple as that. (One might also think that it would be the first instinct of a journalist before spreading the news.)

According to the communications department of the parent company of McDonald's in Chicago (reliable source, we believe), franchises in question are indeed pizza. Except that ""this is not the McPizza, the product of the 1990s that people are familiar with,"" said the inspector viral communications director for Eastern Canada Jason Patuano, reached by telephone.

We are told that these two franchises that have the same owner, are an ""isolated incident"" and that McDonald's allows them exceptionally to add items to their menu. But McDonald's is clear: the pizzas they serve are ""perhaps an interpretation"" of the McPizza, but they are not the true McPizza. McDonald's no longer produces McPizza we do we provide.

You read it here first!

For English readers: The orginial story that ran on Canada.com, and which went viral, claimed that the McPizza was still available in two McDonald’s franchises in Pomeroy, Ohio and Spencer, West Virginia. We contacted the McDonald’s head office. They have confirmed that the two franchises do in fact sell pizza, but that it is not McPizza, the product from the 1990’s. McDonald’s exceptionally allows these two franchises to add items to their menu, but the head office in Chicago said that the pizzas made on-site and are «probably an interpretation» of the McPizza, but they not the real thing.

1811,"Last night, Pando reported that Apple is about to acquire Path, according to a single source in Apple's engineering team. We heard second-hand that Path is at least in talks with Apple. The idea that an app currently ranked no. 177 in the social networking category on iOS might end up in Apple's ion-strengthened embrace has left some in the tech community questioning their life choices.

But do not despair, fair founders! There are plenty of reasons why this deal is just business as usual in Silicon Valley and not the end of days.

1. Friends Buying Friends Acquisitions tend to be chummy affair. For example, Path CEO Dave Morin invested in Hot Potato, a company run by his ski buddy Justin Shaffer, Morin worked for Facebook, Facebook acquired Hot Potato. Karma, another Morin investment, was also acquired by Facebook. And Dave started his career at Apple helping give out iPods on college campuses. See, all in the family.

2. Buying CoolApple, which has $150 billion in cash, has been proven itself willing to buy new fans before with the Beats acquisition. But Path is the opposite of cool, you say. That is true, but Morin has proven himself to be a savvy and popular angel investor. In the interest of succession planning, a source told Valleywag, why wouldn't Apple let Morin rest and vest if it meant young CEOs dropping by Cupertino? ""He's a good exec, he's just a sub-par product person. He did well at Apple and Facebook because they had good products,"" added the source.

3. Messaging ManiaSilicon Valley corporations got smoked by Asian messaging apps. People like to communicate with their friends, who knew? Pando says that's part of Apple's renewed interest in social:

According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple's newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn't mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook's $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.

Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user.

Perhaps we'll hear more about the price tag when Morin takes the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in less than an hour.

4. No One Even Expects Acquisitions to SucceedSelling out can be a bummer not just for those in golden handcuffs, but for the buyers, says Pando:

Apple hasn't fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.

There, feel better?

1812,"TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.
""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.""

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.""

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"".

Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.""

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"".

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added.

Hababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.",tehran fna iraq army shot two british plane carrying weapon isil terrorist al anbar province senior lawmaker disclosed monday iraqi parliament national security defense committee

1816,"A real-life zombie cat truly exists! A buried cat clawed his way out of his grave after being left for dead alongside a road in Florida. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay has taken in the miracle cat and hopes to do their best to help save him.

Rescuers tell FOX 13 in Tampa Bay that the miracle kitty has severe trauma to his head, has a dead eye, a broken jaw, and other serious injuries.

Ellis Hutson is the cat’s owner and says “Bart” was hit by a vehicle and left for dead. He buried his beloved cat several days ago and is amazed Bart survived his horrendous ordeal.

Bart wound up on a neighbor’s front yard after he dug himself out of the grave. Hutson told rescuers that he was certain he was dead. He has no way of explaining how the buried cat clawed his way out of his grave. When they found the zombie cat alive, he was rushed to the veterinarian hospital.

Bart will have an operation, but will lose one eye.

“This doesn’t happen. Cats don’t just come back to life. Not five days after they’ve been put in the ground,” Hutson’s neighbor said, according to News 96.5.

Doctors at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay are scheduling surgery to save Bart’s life. There’s no guarantee he’ll make it, but his good luck after fooling everyone into thinking he was dead may be an indicator as to how well he pulls through again!

FOX 13 reports that rescuers tell them they believe Bart may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and decided to hide out for a few days. They believe Bart will live, but will lose one of his eyes.

Bart is still in good spirits despite being hit by a car then buried alive. He purrs when he gets attention, loves being pet, and acts as though nothing happened. The black-and-white cat is very much a big mess – covered in dirt and dried up blood. When he gets all fixed up again, he should be good to go.

The Inquisitr wrote on another animal that was believed dead, but dug itself out of a grave. A hamster was buried in the ground and 24 hours later managed to crawl out.

The story about a buried cat clawing his way out of his grave is good news for his owner who hated parting with his pet. It’s yet one more story of a cat having nine lives!

1823,"Much has been said already about how the release of the Apple Watch will be the biggest change in Apple products since the company began selling touchscreen devices. However, Apple's new smartwatch will also bring about a small, albeit interesting change to their retail locations: the installation of safes. Not just small, personal safes like you may have in your closet, but large, professional ones like you often see in traditional jewelry stores. Sources say these forthcoming lockboxes are intended for one thing: to store the high-end Apple Watch Edition timepieces that come in luxurious gold.

Speaking to 9 to 5 Mac, these sources say that some Apple Stores are already seeing safe installations take place, ahead of the expected April release of the Apple Watch. The safes are expected to be used to securely house the stock of the upscale Apple Watch models, along with the demo units from the floor, overnight when the store is closed, much like the practice at jewelry retailers.

Of course, any old ""normal"" safes would be fit for Apple and their premium goods. The safes Apple Stores will be getting are said to be custom-designed, and feature installed MagSafe chargers for the Apple Watch, which will keep the demo units ready for display the following day.

We're still awaiting an announcement from Apple about the pricing of the Apple Watch. The company previously revealed that the base model wearable in aluminum will have a starting price of $349, but the higher end stainless steel and Edition models are still anyone's guess. Because the Edition model is set to feature yellow or rose gold, it is expected to be priced at well into the thousands.

If Apple didn't feel it needed safes before to hold its top of the line computers, which already cost several thousands in most cases, then it's probably a good bet that the Apple Watch Edition is going to be their most expensive product.",much said already release apple watch biggest change apple product since company began selling touchscreen device however apple new smartwatch also bring small albeit interesting change retail location installation safe small personal safe like may closet large professional one like often see traditional jewelry store source say forthcoming lockbox intended one thing store high end apple watch edition timepiece come luxurious gold speaking mac source say apple store already seeing safe installation take place ahead expected april release apple watch safe expected used securely house stock upscale apple watch model along demo unit floor overnight store closed much like practice jewelry retailer course old normal safe would fit apple premium good safe apple store getting said custom designed feature installed magsafe charger apple watch keep demo unit ready display following day still awaiting announcement apple pricing apple watch company previously revealed base model wearable aluminum starting price higher end stainless steel edition model still anyone guess edition model set feature yellow rose gold expected priced well thousand apple feel needed safe hold top line computer already cost several thousand case probably good bet apple watch edition going expensive product,company began selling touchscreen device however apple new smartwatch also bring small personal safe like may closet large professional one like often see traditional jewelry store source say forthcoming lockbox intended one thing store high end apple watch edition timepiece come luxurious gold speaking mac source say apple store already seeing safe installation take place ahead expected april release apple watch safe expected used securely house stock upscale apple watch model along demo unit floor overnight store closed much like practice jewelry retailer course old normal safe would fit apple premium good safe apple store getting said custom designed feature installed magsafe charger apple
1824,"As if women were not subjugated enough already in Saudi Arabia, the nation’s Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced yesterday that “tempting eyes” would be subject to veils if deemed inappropriate.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian committee, said in the announcement that, ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.""

The new ban on well-manufactured facial features is broad enough to lead to some inquiry on the definition of ""tempting eyes."" Moreover, what is the process by which a woman will be found guilty of having “tempting eyes?” A humorous image can only come to mind with long lines of “tempting eyed women” waiting to be brought before the 1984-esque committee.

According to an unnamed journalist in Saudi Arabia, “tempting eyes” could possibly be defined with these stipulations: ""Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.""

The unnamed journalist went onto say, ""It's so stupid. I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

While in most Western nations there is harsh divide between Church and State, in Saudi Arabia no such segmentation exists. In March, King Abdullah awarded the committee more than $53 million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated 3,500 to 4,000 religious police officers, which patrol the streets.

As King Abdullah nears the end of his reign, there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow. Prince Naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne, but after giving his support to the committee, there is little hope that Saudi Arabia will evolve in the human rights department.

""The committee is supported by all sides,” Naif said. “It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.""

The parental “because I told you so” argument lacks logic and rationale, but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule. It remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with ""tempting eyes,"" but if there is a great enough dissenting voices, public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy.

There is no truth at all to these allegations at this time. They say that their source is TMZ but there is nothing on their website about it at all. This site is actually a website that likes to spread hoax and make up fake news. They do this and bring in page views. This time it is working for them because everyone is spreading the news on Facebook. This report says that Raven Symone says that she was drugged and raped years ago. Snopes has also shared that this is a fake story. At this time, Raven Symone has not accused him of anything.

Wet Paint shared the news that Janice Dickinson is revealing that Bill Cosby molested her as well. This report is a true one so you never know who will come out next. She says that it happened in 1982 when she was contacted by Cosby about a role. She shared that he gave her wine and a pill. Janice remembers him being over her and waking up the next morning with semen between her legs. She says that she didn't speak out over fear of being labeled.

1838,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +2.00%  plans to break in two, separating its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax-free distribution of shares to the company’s stockholders next year, one of the people said.

The move is one H-P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world, underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—if not actively sought by them.

On Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

In 2012, under current H-P CEO Meg Whitman, H-P reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation.

Ms. Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the separate, so-called enterprise company, one of the people said. Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business, this person said.

In fiscal 2013, the printing and personal systems group, as it is known, inked $55.9 billion in revenue, about half the Palo Alto, Calif., company’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for the company as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P, famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago, has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms. Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business, the rest of H-P’s revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data-storage systems to corporations, as well as software and financial services.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since last year, but are still well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

To combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

H-P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year, the company held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but those negotiations, which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion, recently ended.

1842,"UNITED NATIONS – Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

1850,"Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner had a ""magical moment"" last week when she ended a young man's werewolf curse — that is, if you believe South American folklore.

Kirchner shared photos from a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony on her blog, and described ""adopting"" a young man named Yair Tawil. He is the seventh son of his family, and because of that, was supposedly cursed to become a werewolf on every full moon after his 13th birthday — unless he is adopted by another family. According to legend, seventh daughters become witches.

Enter Argentina's presidents, who since 1907 have been adopting — symbolically, anyway — seventh children so that their families can avoid the superstitious stigma of having a ""cursed"" child. The practice has traditionally involved Catholic children, but that was changed by presidential decree in 2009.

Under Argentine law, seventh children adopted by the president receive a gold medal and an education scholarship until they turn 21. Last Tuesday's ritual was the first time someone of the Jewish faith was adopted by a president. Yair's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had first written a letter asking that their seventh son be adopted in 1993, when he was born, reported the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

In a series of tweets, Kirchner called the ceremony ""magical"" and the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""",argentina president christina fern ndez de kirchner magical moment last week ended young man werewolf curse believe south american folklore kirchner shared photo hanukkah candle lighting ceremony blog described adopting young man named yair tawil seventh son family supposedly cursed become werewolf every full moon th birthday unless adopted another family according legend seventh daughter become witch enter argentina president since adopting symbolically anyway seventh child family avoid superstitious stigma cursed child practice traditionally involved catholic child changed presidential decree argentine law seventh child adopted president receive gold medal education scholarship turn last tuesday ritual first time someone jewish faith adopted president yair parent shlomo nehama tawil first written letter asking seventh son adopted born reported jewish telegraphic agency series tweet kirchner called ceremony magical tawils marvelous family,argentina president christina fern ndez de kirchner magical moment last week ended young man werewolf curse believe south american folklore kirchner shared photo hanukkah candle lighting ceremony blog described adopting young man named yair tawil seventh son family supposedly cursed become werewolf every full moon th birthday unless adopted another family according legend seventh daughter become witch enter argentina president since adopting symbolically anyway seventh child family avoid superstitious stigma cursed
1851,"Although Joan Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure, her time spent there was anything but routine.

As RadarOnline.com has previously reported, Rivers’ female ear, nose and throat doctor stepped in once Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Rivers’ gastroenterologist, discovered something on her vocal cords. The ENT, who wasn’t authorized to perform any medical procedures at the clinic, took over and began a biopsy.

PHOTOS: Celebrities Who Died In Bizarre Circumstances

The biopsy was not authorized, as Rivers never signed a consent form. And once it began, her vocal cords began to swell, Anderson 360 revealed Tuesday night. But that’s not all. Not only was the ENT not supposed to be treating the comedienne, 81, at this time, medical staffers have also told investigators that the ENT snapped a selfie with the Fashion Police star while she was under anesthesia – a major violation of privacy, given she did not give her consent to have her picture taken.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

1856,"Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of Islamic State leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded Islamic State figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

1861,"Dr Gwen Korovin was inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic when the star died

Is alleged to have taken a selfie with her before she went into cardiac arrest

Sources close to the doctor, 56, say reports she took photo are 'lies'

Statement by her attorneys says she's 'respected and admired by peers'

56-year-old ENT was not supposed to be in the room during the procedure

'Lies': Dr Gwen Korovin insists reports she took a selfie with Joan Rivers before she went into cardiac arrest are not true

Joan Rivers' personal doctor has said reports she took a selfie with the star before the procedure that allegedly killed the comedienne are 'lies'.

Dr Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident.

Reports suggest the 'throat specialist to the stars' took a photo of the 81-year-old inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 before the star stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords.

However sources close to the ENT have accused CNN - who originally published the story - of 'making up lies'.

According to TMZ she has also denied performing a biopsy on Joan. However it is unknown whether she performed any other procedure while in the room.

Attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman acting on behalf of the medical professional released a statement today, saying she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident.

It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains priveleges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

'For these reasons, neither Dr Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press pleases respect Dr Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients.'

The doctor who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan.

Joan arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. She died on September 4.

The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords.

The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist who is reported to be Dr Korovin.

It has been reported that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest.

The comedienne was then rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic.

However, she never regained consciousness and died days later after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects.

Dr Korovin has been earmarked as one of the top specialists in the country and is the choice of many celebrities. She has even been involved in a documentary with Celine Dion.

During a clip from the program, Dr Gwen Korovin is seen conducting an laryngoscopy on the Canadian singer, using a camera to examine Dion's vocal chords as she sings a few notes.

The two go on to share a few laughs in Dr Korovin's clinic room, covered with framed photos of her famous clientele.

1868,"A pregnant St. Louis woman was blinded in her left eye after a police officer on Tuesday fired a non-lethal bean bag round at her car on the outskirts of Ferguson, according to reports. The woman claimed on Facebook that she had to have her eye removed.

Dornnella Conner was sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle at a BP gas station on New Halls Ferry Road in St. Louis when the incident occurred, New York Daily News reported. Police had been called to the area after reports of trouble during a night of unrest in Ferguson and across the U.S..

Conner's boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, was reportedly driving the car out of the gas station when police opened fire.

Conner says he was trying to drive around the officers. However, police say he was driving toward them, and that the officer fired because he feared for his own safety, according to local media. The bean bag round hit and shattered the front passenger window.

""I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown,"" she told local media outlet KMOV.

""I'm very upset and very disappointed with the tactics that they used,"" Conner's father Donnell added. ""I understand that it was chaos, but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle. How can a pregnant person, in a car in a seatbelt, be causing chaos?”

Conner subsequently vowed to seek justice for the incident on her Facebook page (where she also goes by the name ""Lenora Prince""). ""I will have justice for what they've done to me,"" she wrote, ""But I'm happy I'm alive.""

1870,"Inside sources say Apple is shutting down the Beats Music streaming service. The news comes mere months after Apple’s plans to buy Beats were revealed. Here’s what you need to know.

1. Multiple Sources Are Confirming the End of Beats
beats-music-iphone-app

TechCrunch reports that multiple sources have confirmed Apple’s plans to shut down Beats Music, including “several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.” As many as five people close to the deal have confirmed the rumor about the end of Beats Music.


2. Beats Music Might End, But Beats Headphones Will Continue

Apple Insider writes “The rumor [about Beats Music shutting down] would suggest that Apple’s $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ‘acqui-hires’ of Beats’s Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.”

Entrepreneur magazine notes that Apple paid $3.2 billion to acquire Beats earlier this year. The same article notes that Beats has had a rapid rise to the top: In 2012, just four years after Beats began selling headphones, the company had 40 percent market share. The headphone part of the Beats brand is still very much alive and kicking.


3. Beats Music May Get Rolled Into iTunes

Business Insider predicts that the Beats Music streaming service will be absorbed into the larger iTunes ecosystem:

“It’s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes and/or iTunes Radio. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he “couldn’t sleep” after listening to it for the first time. That doesn’t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off.

Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. “The sentence” gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think “I’m on a boat” or “I’m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time”).”


4. Apple Is Planning A Mysterious New Music Project

The Verge notes that there are rumors that Apple is planning a “significant music announcement” for next year. The shutdown of Beats Music may be the first step towards making that big announcement, whatever it may be.

Apple’s other big announcement in the first half of 2015 will be the official release date of the Apple Watch. Perhaps the Apple Watch will be involved in Apple’s next music project in some way, though it is too early to say so with any degree of certainty.



5. The Beats Music App Was Only Added to Apple TV a Few Days Ago

Apple Insider notes that a Beats Music app was just added to the Apple TV interface on September 17, making the plans for a Beats Music shutdown seem even more surprising. It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It’s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won’t shut down the service overnight. Expect Apple to give the service a final termination date that’s some distance in the future.",inside source say apple shutting beat music streaming service news come mere month apple plan buy beat revealed need know multiple source confirming end beat beat music iphone app techcrunch report multiple source confirmed apple plan shut beat music including several prominent employee apple beat many five people close deal confirmed rumor end beat music beat music might end beat headphone continue jimmy iovine jimmy iovine dr dre getty apple insider writes rumor beat music shutting would suggest apple billion buyout beat really headphone side business well talent credibility brought acqui hire beat jimmy iovine dr dre entrepreneur magazine note apple paid billion acquire beat earlier year article note beat rapid rise top four year beat began selling headphone company percent market share headphone part beat brand still much alive kicking beat music may get rolled itunes beat apple getty business insider predicts beat music streaming service absorbed larger itunes ecosystem likely apple take beat music technology incorporate itunes itunes radio apple ceo tim cook recently told charlie rose impressed beat music sleep listening first time sound like product cook would want completely kill beat music also neat feature apple might want incorporate future product sentence give user opportunity select music based activity location think boat rooftop feel like going back time apple planning mysterious new music project iphone iphone apple apple keynote iphone event iphone photo iphone plus iphone picture new iphone getty verge note rumor apple planning significant music announcement next year shutdown beat music may first step towards making big announcement whatever may apple big announcement first half official release date apple watch perhaps apple watch involved apple next music project way though early say degree certainty beat music app added apple tv day ago roku v apple tv apple tv v chromecast best set top box best tv dongle best tv alternative best internet tv device roku chromecast tv alternative comparison roku comparison apple tv comparison chromecast comparison getty apple insider note beat music app added apple tv interface september making plan beat music shutdown seem even surprising seem odd apple would add beat apple tv one week start shutting service week later fair assume rumor true apple killing beat music shut service overnight expect apple give service final termination date distance future,say apple shutting beat music streaming service news come mere month apple plan buy beat revealed need know multiple source confirming end beat beat beat beat music iphone app techcrunch report multiple source confirmed apple plan shut beat music including several prominent employee apple beat many five people close deal confirmed rumor end beat beat beat beat beat music might end beat headphone continue jimmy iovine jimmy iovine dr dre getty apple insider writes rumor beat music shutting would suggest apple billion buy
1872,"From a reader in Hong Kong:

I was at the uneventful (if tense) Legco [Legislative Council] demonstration on Saturday as well as last night's demonstrations between Causeway Bay and Central.

It was as much depressing as, ultimately, uplifting. When I was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray, I somehow found myself being reverse crowd-surfed to a safe area.

There, a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes. Some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs. When they went on to help the next injured person, an old woman kept watch over me, speaking soft Cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks. These were complete strangers. Later, when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack, a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety.
When we felt threatened, we opened umbrellas and raised our hands.

When the police decided to retake the street, they sprayed chemicals in our faces, pointed rifles at us, smashed our limbs with batons. While they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon, our side threw not one rock, not one bottle, not one egg, nothing. None from our side brandished a firearm, a knife, a club, anything at all. I have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting, burning cars, destroying property, or intentionally injuring police.

Young women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls. In what other city would tens of thousands of 'rioters' act with such restraint?

The government warned against the chaos Occupy Central would cause. It's all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity. These demonstrations may have been sparked by anger, but they're sustained by compassion and love.
I have been working around the clock on a non-China-related magazine project (as the time of this post indicates) and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in Hong Kong.

It is of course interesting to note the spread of the ""hands-up/ don't shoot!"" gesture from Ferguson to Hong Kong, but the circumstances in the two places have 100 times more differences than similarities. There are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among Chinese people, namely the movements throughout China in the summer of 1989.

What is happening in Hong Kong is uplifting, for reasons this reader explains—and surprising, for anyone who knows the generally non-politicized nature of Hong Kong.

But it is also quite a sobering time, as soon as you think about the options open to the PRC government in Beijing, and the instincts it has displayed in the face of all recent challenges of this sort. Beyond question, this is a challenge that the still-relatively new government of ""Mr. 11,"" Xi Jinping, has brought upon himself. That doesn't mean that it will end nicely.

1874,"KABUL, Afghanistan — An Afghan mother has become a hero among some of her countrymen after allegedly fighting the Taliban militants who had just killed her policeman son.

Reza Gul, a resident of Balabolok district of western Farah province, said she rushed to the small police outpost near her home after it came under attack early on November 17.

She told NBC News she screamed in anger and grief when she saw her son Safiullah — who had been guarding the outpost along with a group of lightly armed policemen — shot dead. Then, she said, she took action.

“The Taliban attacked our village and my son’s outpost at dawn,"" explained Gul, who like many in Afghanistan does not know her exact age but who estimates she is between 50 and 60. “After seeing my young son’s body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die.”

Gul spoke to NBC News by telephone from Farah, the capital of Farah Province. NBC News could not independently confirm Gul’s account, although local police and media repeated similar versions of the incident.

“I fought them until dark along with other boys from the police, and [we] killed at least 25 of them,” she added, saying that her husband, daughter-in-law, daughter and her teenage son also joined in and supplied her with ammunition.

Gul's daughter, Fatima, told Afghan television channel Tolo News that she had prepared bullets for her father and mother to fight.

""We started a kind of family war against the Taliban,"" she said.

Gul's daughter-in-law Seema told Tolo News that the fighting intensified when she reached the battlefield armed with a variety of light and heavy weapons, but that ""we were committed to fight until the last bullet.""

Provincial police chief General Abdul Razaq Yaqoobi confirmed that the Taliban had launched a heavy assault on Balabolok district on November 17 with an estimated 400 fighters.

""The police post in Abdul Satar village which was manned by 10 local police and commanded by a local police officer named Safiullah came under heavy shelling and the commander was killed in the gun battle,"" he said.

He added that Safiullah’s mother had joined the policemen after learning of her son's death and taken up his rifle. The mother's presence boosted the morale of policemen resisting the attack, Yaqoobi said, and after seven hours of heavy fighting the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were killed and 31 injured in that village alone, Yaqoobi added.

1879,"Rumors swirled over the weekend that demonstrators in Hong Kong were using the “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

On Sunday, Vox published a story headlined, “Hong Kong’s protesters are using the same ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ gesture used in Ferguson.”

While the article did note that “it’s impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson,” it concluded contending that “it’s fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.”

Other similar stories followed soon after. MSNBC published an article Monday titled, “In Hong Kong, protesters say ‘hands up, don’t shoot!’” The Daily Mail published a story saying that protesters in Hong Kong had copied the gesture used by U.S. demonstrators.

But, a story in Quartz Sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by Hong Kong demonstrators was linked to Ferguson.

According to the story, the gesture used by those in Hong Kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity:

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking “hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.

Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)

The Washington Post followed up Monday with a similar analysis:

Sunday, Max Fisher wrote a story for Vox.com arguing that the ‘hands up don’t shoot’ gesture had spread from protests in Ferguson to the pro-democracy demonstrations on the streets of Hong Kong. However, another writer at Quartz.com, who has actually interviewed protesters, says that this is wrong. The evidence seems to show that the gesture had probably not in fact ‘spread’ as Fisher and other commentators believed. Instead, the activists organizing the protests appear to have independently chosen to hold their hands up to emphasize their peaceful intentions to police.

Vox later corrected their post, addressing the controversy.

“Still, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously,” their story now argues.

As Entertainment.ie reports,

After a number of complaints from passengers about ""random males"" being seated next to their wives, Saudi Arabia's national airline is looking in to segregating their flights.

Saudi Arabia's national airline, Saudia, will order its staff to keep men and women seated separately on flights from now on after passengers complained about the lack of segregation on their flights.

The Emirates247 news website reported that the airline, which already complies with many of the religious practices of Islam including not offering alcohol or dishes that contain pork on their flights, have decided to separate men and women on board, unless they are close relatives.

Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, Saudia's assistant manager for marketing, said that ""there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers"".

1892,"According to a thread on Reddit — so take this with a pinch of salt — Apple CEO Tim Cook personally requested that the ""on hold"" music for people calling customer service be changed and improved after he received an email from an Apple user who was disappointed that the quality of the music was so poor. ""Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done,"" the Reddit user says.

It almost doesn't matter whether this story is true or not. People will believe it because it dovetails seamlessly with Apple's obsession with detail and quality. And the circumstantial evidence leading up the story (told in full, below) is that Cook does indeed personally read the email he gets each day from customers. ""I get hundreds, and some days thousands of emails from customers. This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you're sitting at their kitchen table,"" he once told NBC, according to Apple Insider.

The rap against Cook is that while he might be a good CEO, he may not be the great, visionary CEO that Apple needs. Recently, however, with Apple gearing up to release two large-format iPhone 6 models, an iWatch wearable device and — possibly — some sort of push into healthcare or an extension of Apple TV's capabilities, Cook is looking more and more like The Man.

Part of the case in favor of Cook is not that he is a ranting visionary who can rouse the masses like founder Steve Jobs. Rather, it's that he's a super-manager who can make all the different arms of Apple's now-vast empire work together like Swiss (smart)watch.

So the idea that he would reach down into the company's bowels to tweak the way the on-hold muzak sounds when people call up for help sounds exactly like something this super-manager would do.

Here's what Reddit user ""lerde"" wrote:

I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).

Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.

The next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.

1894,"There have already been been numerous reports that US led coalition planes have been air dropping supplies and weapons to Islamic State terrorists….

From Fars News Agency:

Iraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

Iraqi Army Downs Two UK Planes Carrying Weapons for ISIS

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.

Hababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.",already numerous report u led coalition plane air dropping supply weapon islamic state terrorist far news agency iraq army shot two british plane carrying weapon isil terrorist al

1902,"A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.

Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.

But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.

This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast

The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax.

She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo.

'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.'

Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged

The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep

Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long

Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore.

'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

1903,"Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist in Tampa, Florida, claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous, land a reality show, and become ""unattractive to men"" because she doesn't ""want to date anymore."" From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

Here is Jasmine Tridevil's Twitter.

1907,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

1910,"One tactic that should prevent overly hormonal street-bros from catcalling women is imagining what their own mothers would think of this behavior. In a new Peruvian ad, however, that threat becomes an all-too-real Freudian nightmare.


Athletics brand Everlast recently teamed up with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero (Stop Street Harassment) to teach catcallers on the streets of Lima what their mothers apparently never taught them--by using the people in the world most suited for that very task. In the viral video, which is clearly staged, although it's fun to pretend that it isn't, the Paremos team gets hold of the mothers of area serial harassers and recruits them for a guerrilla mission to end their sons' lives.


These women disguise themselves with dresses, wigs and a copious amount of makeup to go undercover as catcall-bait--and it works to a degree that will alternately delight and horrify. It's probably the funniest possible way to call attention to the fact that 7 out of 10 women on the streets of Peru are sexually assaulted.

1914,"The son of a North Korean aide linked to Kim Jong-un's executed uncle is believed to be on the run in France after evading abduction by agents of the communist regime.

According to diplomatic sources, the man - identified only by his surname Han - has escaped detection amid fears he may be forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed.

The architecture student has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason in December 2013.

The student disappeared after his father was executed by the regime led by Kim-Jong-Un (pictured)

He disappeared last month while studying at Paris' prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette and speculation was rife as to whether the student had been captured or was hiding out in France.

But now a diplomatic source has revealed that despite attempts to force Han to return to North Korea, the student has evaded capture as is 'somewhere in France', The Telegraph reported.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea's biggest news agency which broke the story, told the newspaper: 'Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

'If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.'

Han disappeared last month while studying at the prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette (pictured)

There are fears that the student may be forcibly taken back to the North Korea to be executed (pictured, Kim Jong-Un during a ceremony for officials and personnel in the fishery field of the Korean People's Army)

Han is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer.

The student had been enrolled at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government.

The disappearance comes amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in the wake of the Sony Entertainment hacking scandal and the release of The Interview, a film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un.

As with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations.

However, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities.

Jang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup.

Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and mentor was purged last December after being accused of a coup. Han is reported to have links to Jang, as his father was one of Jang's advisors

According to reports the student may have escaped his captors, but it is not known if he was recaptured or if he is hiding somewhere in France (Kim Jong-un pictured on a visit to a fish factory in North Korea)

In a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'.

Since then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out.

There were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks.

However he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle.",son north korean aide linked kim jong un executed uncle believed run france evading abduction agent communist regime according diplomatic source man identified surname han escaped detection amid fear may forcibly taken back secretive nation executed architecture student tie kim jong un uncle jang song thaek regime former second command executed treason december scroll video student disappeared father executed regime led kim jong un pictured disappeared last month studying paris prestigious ecole nationale superieure architecture de paris la villette speculation rife whether student captured hiding france diplomatic source revealed despite attempt force han return north korea student evaded capture somewhere france telegraph reported park sung jin paris correspondent yonhap south korea biggest news agency broke story told newspaper since regime change someone executed relative friend family studying abroad brought home han returned would likely kept political prison executed happened many time knew awaiting escaped han disappeared last month studying prestigious ecole nationale superieure architecture de paris la villette pictured fear student may forcibly taken back north korea executed pictured kim jong un ceremony official personnel fishery field korean people army han son one jang song thaek closest aide father known purged recently kim attempt reassert authority disappearing summer student enrolled french school since along nine student invited join french government disappearance come amid high tension u north korea wake sony entertainment hacking scandal release interview film assassination kim jong un western nation north korea official tie paris maintains small delegation deal limited economic negotiation however relation two nation risk damaged transpires han sheltered french authority jang kim jong un mentor second command uncle executed treason last december accused planning coup jang song thaek kim uncle mentor purged last december accused coup han reported link jang father one jang advisor according report student may escaped captor known recaptured hiding somewhere france kim jong un pictured visit fish factory north korea statement time pyongyang called jang song thaek traitor nation age worse dog despicable human scum since potentially hundred supporter relative rounded either executed sent labour camp kim sought wipe jang family thought kim could deposed summer pictured limping state event going missing several week however soon back spotlight official said gone missing order cyst removed ankle,son north korean aide linked kim jong un uncle believed run france evading abduction agent communist regime according diplomat source man identified surname han escaped detection amid fear may forcibly taken back secretive nation executed architecture student tie kim jong un uncle jang song thaek regime former second command executed treason last december .
1915,"Several Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists. The notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.

The Attagara and Kawuri villages in Gwoza and Bama Local Government Areas of Borno State resisted the attack using an array of local talismans and, of course, their assault weapons came in handy as well.

Almost immediately, the community rallied round to apprehend the insurgents. At least three of the terrorists managed to flee, but community members say that seven were arrested and executed.




?
Local residents said that the initial attack happened when the terrorists that the villagers described as Boko Haram came into town on motorcycles. Stories are already building up in the aftermath of the victory, as some locals claim that the men were paralyzed by local talismans protecting the initial women who the men encountered.

The initial women were said to have then gone to their local militia which included a number of armed women, who promptly raced to the scene, repelled and executed the attackers.

Mamman Yakubu, a youth that participated in the resistance, said that they killed the terrorists because Boko Haram members never talk when interrogated, and they did not want to risk any of them getting away.

1919,"Lately, Apple cEO has been making the rounds in Europe, stopping at various stores and chatting with employees. Now and then, we get tidbits of info about his chats. The last time we heard anything about his commentary on Apple Watch, it was that he wore it in the shower, suggesting it’s a bit more water resistant than originally thought. Cook also said the Apple Watch was good for a full day of use. Now, he’s saying it will be available outside the US just after launch.

According to unnamed employees, Apple’s CEO says the Apple Watch will be available outside the US in April. Cook reportedly said this to Apple Store employees in Berlin, and said, specifically, that the Apple Watch would come to Germany sometime in early April.

There was no word on if any other countries or regions were specifically mentioned by Cook.

This is another exciting piece to the puzzle for those anticipating big things from Apple on March 9. Though we’ve got quite a bit of insight on Apple Watch, we don’t know it all.

So far, Apple is busy erecting a tent just outside the events hall where they’ll (presumably) give us more details on the Apple Watch next week. Though not necessarily confirmed as an Apple Watch hub, the tent is reminiscent of the outdoor space Apple erected last Fall, when they officially announced their wearable.

Until we know for sure, rumors of Apple Watch coming to more countries than the one I live in is exciting news. In the past, Apple (like most companies) launched stateside before gently rolling their items to other countries. With an expected first-run of 5 million Apple Watches, though, the company might have no reason not to let interested fans slap one on their wrist.

1927,"TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”",tehran fna iraq army shot two british plane carrying weapon isil terrorist al anbar province senior lawmaker disclosed monday iraqi parliament national security defense committee access photo plane british crashed carrying weapon isil head committee hakem al zameli said according monday report arabic language information center islamic supreme council iraq said iraqi parliament asked london explanation regard senior iraqi legislator unveiled government baghdad receiving daily report people security force al anbar province numerous flight u led coalition plane airdrop weapon supply isil terrorist held area iraqi lawmaker noted cause western aid terrorist group explained u prefers chaotic situation anbar province near city karbala baghdad want isil crisis come end earlier today senior iraqi provincial official lashed western country regional ally supporting takfiri terrorist iraq revealing u israeli made weapon discovered area purged isil terrorist discovered weapon made u european country israel area liberated isil control al baqdadi region al ahad news website quoted head al anbar provincial council khalaf tarmouz saying noted weapon made european country israel discovered terrorist eastern part city ramadi al zameli also disclosed january anti isil coalition plane dropped weapon foodstuff isil salahuddin al anbar diyala province al zameli underlined coalition main cause isil survival iraq proof evidence u led coalition military aid isil terrorist air dropped cargo told fna january noted member committee already proved u plane dropped advanced weaponry including anti aircraft weapon isil set investigation committee probe matter u drop weapon isil excuse knowing whereabouts isil position trying distort reality allegation noted committee collected data evidence provided eyewitness including iraqi army officer popular force said document given investigation committee necessary measure taken protect iraqi airspace,tehran fna iraq army shot two british plane carrying weapon isil terrorist al anbar province senior lawmaker disclosed monday iraqi parliament national security defense committee access photo plane british crashed carrying weapon isil head committee hakem al zameli said monday iraqi parliament national security defense committee access photo plane british crashed carrying weapon isil terrorist al anbar province senior lawmaker disclosed monday iraq

Abu Obeida (or Ubaidah) al-Masri, secretary of the Zakat (charity) bureau and treasurer of IS Syrian branch, eloped with the funds amounting to ""billion Syrian pounds"" which have been collected by his department in Deir Ez Zour province, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper reported, citing Syrian Press Center news site.

According to some rumours, IS militants have issued an order to stop recruiting Egyptian jihadists because of the incident.

The claim could not be independently verified by IBTimes UK.

IS imposed a Zakat tax on merchants and industrialists in the areas under its control in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Isis ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

The merchants told the militants that they are already paying money to the poor families, but IS responded that those families should report to the Zakat bureau instead.

""The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,"" IS reportedly said.

Jihadi John, the British terrorist who beheaded two British and two American hostages, has been “injured” in an airstrike, according to reports.

The Islamic State (IS) executioner was said to have “narrowly escaped death” when jets bombed a meeting of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town.

The joint US and Iraqi airstrikes are thought to have taken place last Saturday on an area close to the Syrian border.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are aware of the reports but we cannot confirm these reports.”

They declined to give any detail of the reports or where they originated.

According to the Mail on Sunday, quoting a nurse, Jihadi John and other wounded ISIS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

1935,"Wounded? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted

Speculation is mounting that the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was indeed killed in a US led airstrike on Friday.

On Sunday senior Iraqi officials confirmed that the leader of the Islamic State group was at the very least wounded in the coalition attack and said that the terror chief's right hand man, Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, had perished during the aerial assault.

Elefery, who is known by his code name Abu Suja, died when planes hit an ISIS convoy near Mosul in northern Iraq.

However, conflicting reports surround the fate of Baghdadi.

ISIS members have taken to social media to claim that he was not traveling in the same convoy that claimed Elefery's life, while other sources have stated that the feared warlord was killed or seriously injured in the airstrike.

An Iraqi security official, Hisham al-Hashimi, told the UK's Daily Telegraph that Elefery was 'Baghdadi's very close companion' and was killed in the attack which destroyed up to 10 vehicles.

'He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him at the time of the attack,' he said to the British newspaper.

Hashimi revealed that Elefery's death was confirmed to him by relatives.

General Nicholas Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff of the British Armed Forces told the Daily Telegraph: 'I can't absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has been killed. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.'

An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province.

The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Neither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi's apparent injuries. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential material. State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

However, Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or al-Baghdadi being wounded.

Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head.

Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.

A U.S.-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive.

The Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray.

Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq

On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce.

The plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100. There now are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, out of the 1,600 previously authorized.

Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.

Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.

Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.

A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.

Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.

Striking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.

A provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.

Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.

The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.

Iraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.

Separately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.

U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.

IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'

The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.

It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.

The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.

On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.

The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.

Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.

'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.

In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.

The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.

In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.

Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.

President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.

The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.

Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group.

He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history.

But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world.

The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous.

This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'.

But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year.

Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam.

In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends.

But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation.

American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009.

He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast.

But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly.

After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.

The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.

Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.

Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.

Police Colonel Shaaban Barazan al-Ubaidi, commander of a rapid reaction force in Anbar, said security forces retook eight villages. His account could not be immediately confirmed.

Why evil ISIS boss al-Baghdadi may be FAKING his own death in a Homeland-style plot to dupe the West

In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson (pictured) is very much alive, pulling the strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans

The ‘kill mission’ against Islamic State boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi carries chilling echoes of TV show Homeland where the chief terror suspect Haissam Haqqani is supposedly killed in a drone attack.

In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson is very much alive, pulling the insurgent strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans.

I wonder if al-Baghdadi is doing the same. It would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus, he's risen from beyond the grave before.

Even now, the Pentagon is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive ‘caliph’ – and we are none the wiser.

Could it be telling that the news of his death apparently leaked out from ISIS itself?

So far, U.S. officials are working on inference.

Late on Friday night, American warplanes hit a ten-car convoy southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS’s capital in northern Iraq.

Among the 20 people thought to have been killed was Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, who is known by his code name Abu Sajar, a key aide to Baghdadi.

If Abu Sajar was there, it is likely that Baghdadi was too, though he may also be among the casualties who were rushed to Mosul hospitals, where there were urgent appeals over loudspeakers for blood donations.

According to Iraqi sources, parallel attacks on Qaim in Anbar province killed one of the terror group's top strategists in a predominantly Sunni region where ISIS has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world’s attention was distracted by its relentless siege of Kobane in northern Syria.

Normally so effusive on social media, ISIS are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend, though it has started arresting former members of the Iraqi army lest they are providing the US with actionable intelligence.

ISIS is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed, including Baghdadi himself.

Baghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity, especially since his Al Qaeda mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing raid in 2006.

Except for his brief appearance in Mosul in July to proclaim himself Caliph (an office that fuses political and religious leadership), Baghdadi has kept a low profile, so that the fate of ISIS does not appear to hinge on his personal survival.

It also offers the perfect cover should Baghdadi wish to disappear for a while, Homeland-style.

For Baghdadi has been careful to organize ISIS in such a way that power is highly decentralised, with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations.

ISIS has been careful to include many Sunni tribal figures in administration, precisely to pre-empt any U.S. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them, a strategy the Americans pursued against Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS’s forerunner) in 2007-08 with some success.

Targeted: Baghdadi was reportedly wounded on Friday night when American warplanes hit a ten-car ISIS convoy like this one southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS's capital in northern Iraq (file picture)

ISIS’s military command includes at least two Sunni Muslim Iraqi army generals on the run since the Saddam era, who clearly have considerable tactical ability.

ISIS has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres.

They also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing, and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their Iraqi or Kurdish opponents.

So far, the U.S. response has been to remove the unpopular Shia prime minister of Iraq, to reduce the alienation of the country’s Sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the Iraqi national army, which, poorly led, effectively fled from this ferocious opponent.

The only effective obstacles to ISIS taking over the country have been Shia militias in Baghdad and further south, and the Kurdish peshmerga in the north.

Although the U.S. has added a further 1,500 military advisers, bringing their total strength to over 3000, they have to be careful since the same Shia militias are restive about a renewed U.S. ‘occupation’ of Iraq.

American airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm.

So far there have been an average of five strikes a day, compared with 50 in Libya in 2011, 85 in Afghanistan, and 800 a day in Iraq itself during the 2003 US-led invasion.

So far, only 800 of the 3, 200 sorties over Iraq and Syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles.

Until these raids at the weekend, there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground, while Pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties.

The long distance planes have to fly from bases in Qatar or the UAE, or from carriers in the Persian Gulf, also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity.

So while it would be a significant blow to ISIS to lose its self-styled Caliph, he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities. And he may yet rise from ‘the dead’.",wounded abu bakr al baghdadi leader called islamic state said among targeted speculation mounting leader isi abu bakr al baghdadi indeed killed u led airstrike

1937,"Despite a wild report on a website dedicated to conspiracy theories, local soldiers haven't lost a low-yield nuclear weapon.

As the lockdown of soldiers in a Fort Carson battalion dragged into its fifth day Monday, the site Whatdoesitmean.com reported that a nuclear artillery shell was missing - an item that hasn't been in the Army inventory for 22 years. That story was translated into several languages, including Russian and spread rapidly on the Internet.

Photo - The modified M9-Beretta pistol used for the Basic Active Shooter Course fires a powder propelled paint cup to provide the most realistic training possible while maintaining the level of safety required for the scenarios, Jan 26.  The course is taught by a 4-man training team from the 610th Security Forces Squadron, Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas.  They came to Dobbins Air Reserve Base to provide this critical training for the 94th Security Forces Squadron and other Dobbins area security personnel.  The two day course provides classroom and tactical instruction to first responders covering several shooting spree scenarios.   (U.S. Air Force photo/ Brad Fallin) + caption

Sources at the post told The Gazette that the lockdown involving 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armor Regiment is actually for something more mundane - a 9 mm pistol. The Army hasn't officially released details on what spurred the lockdown and search, calling it ""missing government property.""

The lockdown started with about 800 soldiers confined to the battalion's buildings on the post. That was reduced over the weekend to about 100 soldiers - a company of troops.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Terrance McWilliams, who served as the post's top enlisted soldier, said lockdowns are a common practice commanders use to turn up lost gear.

""I personally went through it as a 1st sergeant and the longest it took was four days,"" said McWilliams.

The lockdown was triggered Thursday after the pistol turned up missing in an equipment inventory that followed a training exercise. Post officials ordered a wide search for the missing weapon Thursday, including inspecting cars as they exited the post at gates.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. John Kurak, who also held Fort Carson's top enlisted post, said a five-day lockdown isn't close to a record for Fort Carson.

""In Fort Carson's history there have been lockdowns that have lasted months,"" Kurak said, noting that an infantry battalion on there spent three months on lockdown in the late 1980s after a M-16 rifle was lost.

McWilliams said the first step in the search for the weapon likely was quizzing the soldier who checked it out from the unit's armory for the training exercise. The battalion's soldiers were returning from a training exercise that spanned a wide swath of the 137,000-acre post.

When it was determined that the weapon was lost, soldiers were likely sent to scouring training areas in a move called ""hands across Fort Carson"" that sees soldiers walking shoulder-to-shoulder to find the missing weapon.

When that didn't bear fruit, soldiers were ordered to remain on duty and on post until the weapon was found - a lockdown.

Long lockdowns like the one that deprived 1st Battalion soldiers of what was a planned four-day weekend, do come to an end.

""Eventually its going to get to the point where they determine the item is actually lost,"" McWilliams said. ""Then they will determine what actions to take against the person responsible for the item.""

Losing a weapon can bring stiff consequences in the military, where loss or destruction of government property can be charged as a crime bringing up to a year behind bars.

The Army spends a lot of time keeping track of pistols, rifles and other ""sensitive"" items. Every training day begins and ends with a sensitive items check, and daily inventories are sent up through the chain of command.

""If you can't keep track of your equipment, how can you be expected to do more complex tasks?"" Kurak asked.

In combat, units heading out and returning from stop for a ""boys and toys"" check to make sure all weapons, night vision goggles, laser sights, radios and other items are on hand.

""Accountability of equipment is a basic and essential function of a unit,"" Kurak said.

While the battalion may have lost a pistol, scores of web pages carried the nuclear weapon tale Monday. That story, attributed to unnamed Russian intelligence sources, alleged that a 155 mm artillery-fired nuclear warhead is missing at the post.

The battalion involved, though, doesn't have artillery. And the W-48 artillery warhead alleged to be missing was pulled from Army bases worldwide in 1992.

While the Pikes Peak region is home to a five military bases, it doesn't house nuclear weapons. The closest nuclear arms are atop Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles at F.E.

1942,"Leelah Alcorn left a heartbreaking suicide note on her Tumblr blog before walking out onto a busy road.

The 17-year-old scheduled the post to go live on her blog in advance before committing suicide on the I-71 highway in Ohio, USA.

The suicide note detailed her early problems with transgender dysphoria and the struggles of growing up in an oppressive household.

She accused her devout Christian parents of blocking her transition and refusing to acknowledge her true gender.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

In a second post, also scheduled, Alcorn wrote: ""Mom and Dad: Fuck you. You can’t just control other people like that. That’s messed up.""

1944,"The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) reportedly beheaded a famous female Kurdish freedom fighter known only as ""Rehana."" The Women Protection Units (YPG) soldier fought against the terrorist group in Kobane, a strategically important border town in Syria near Turkey.
A picture of Rehana making the V-sign became a widely-distributed image online, retweeted over 5,000 times. Reports claimed she killed over 100 Islamic State jihadists single-handedly. But now a picture of a militant holding her head is making the rounds on social media. The death is not confirmed.
Female fighters are essential to the Kurds. The Women Protection Units (YPG) in Kobane are led by Mayass Abdo, who goes by Narin Afrin. All of the female Pershmerga are volunteers and are honored to fight against the terrorists. One such soldier, Dilar Gencxemis, blew herself up outside of Kobane, killing dozens of militants.
Their accomplishments as warriors aside, it is their gender the jihadists fear the most. They believe if they die in jihad, they will be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven. However, if a woman kills them, the men are denied their virgins.
“These [ISIS] soldiers apparently believed that if they were killed in battle, they went to paradise as long as they were killed by a man,” said Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), who chairs the U.S. House International Relations Committee. “And these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to ISIL and had stopped the advance, turned back the advance -- slayed a number of these fighters, who would then run away.”",islamic state isi isil reportedly beheaded famous female kurdish freedom fighter known rehana woman protection unit ypg soldier fought terrorist group kobane strategically important border town syria near turkey picture rehana making v sign became widely distributed image online retweeted time report claimed killed islamic state jihadist single handedly picture militant holding head making round social medium death confirmed female fighter essential kurd woman protection unit ypg kobane led mayas abdo go narin afrin female pershmerga volunteer honored fight terrorist one soldier dilar gencxemis blew outside kobane killing dozen militant accomplishment warrior aside gender jihadist fear believe die jihad rewarded virgin heaven however woman kill men denied virgin isi soldier apparently believed killed battle went paradise long killed man said rep ed royce r ca chair u house international relation committee female soldier communicating satisfaction fact taken fight isil stopped advance turned back advance slayed number fighter would run away,isi isil reportedly beheaded famous female kurdish freedom fighter known rehana woman protection unit ypg soldier fought terrorist group kobane strategically important border town syria near turkey picture rehana making v sign became widely distributed image online retweeted time report claimed killed isi isil reportedly beheaded famous female kurdish freedom fighter known rehana woman protection unit ypg soldier fought terrorist group kobane
1945,"CHICAGO (FOX 32 News) - A frustrated office worker recently called out his colleague for stealing his lunch, prompting a response from the ""sandwich thief"" himself.

The frustrated worker posted a sign on the fridge saying, ""To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (turkey and Swiss with mayo on rye), this is ridiculous. We are full grown adults, not children. Please take responsibility for your actions and stop stealing other people's property!""

The sandwich thief then came back with a response, asking for ransom money for the stolen turkey and Swiss on rye.

""Dear turkey and Swiss on rye, I have your precious sandwich. It's safe. For now. Put 10 dollars on the plate in the fridge or you'll never see it undigested again.""

HR then got involved in the situation and told the alleged thief to give back the sandwich and it won't be investigated.
But it was too late, the sandwich thief already had eaten the coveted lunch! But he didn't get away with it. HR was able to track down the crook.

1947,"A man scheduled to fly from New York to Dallas didn't even make it to takeoff due to some lack of Christmas cheer.

The New York Post reports a man lost his cool repeatedly when American Airlines employees wished him a Merry Christmas.

The Post said the man was waiting to board his flight from LaGuardia Airport on Tuesday when a gate agent greeted people while checking boarding passes.

“You shouldn't say that because not everyone celebrates Christmas,” the man told the agent. The agent then asked what should she say and he told her not to say Merry Christmas.

The man was again greeted with a Merry Christmas by a flight attendant on the plane, which set him off.

The passenger, according to the paper, continued to lecture the flight crew and became so flustered he had to be removed from the plane.

1953,"Hewlett-Packard said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, rose almost 8 percent in premarket trading on Monday. (Get the latest quote here.)

Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.

The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.

The printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division.

HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP Inc.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.

Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift toward mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

Last week online auction company eBay said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

“According to the karma of past actions, one’s destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky . . . Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!” read a tweet from the 47-year-old actress’ purported Twitter account, which was later deactivated.

Bonet played Denise Huxtable on the hit NBC series starring Bill Cosby.

At least 15 women — including model Janice Dickinson — have come forward to accuse the 77-year-old ­comedian of being a sexual predator.

For years, bad blood was rumored to have existed between Bonet and Cosby, who was reportedly incensed by her sex scene with Mickey Rourke in “Angel Heart” in 1987 and a nude magazine photo shoot she did a year later.

1962,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Saudi women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up, the news website Bikya Masr reported, in a move that could mark the latest repressive measure taken against women by the Islamic state.

A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said the committee had the right to stop women revealing ""tempting"" eyes in public.

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to cover their hair, and, in some regions, their faces while in public. If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

The CPVPV has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations. Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.

In 2002 the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover, report said.

1964,"Last week, Apple sent out the invites for its “Spring Forward” event, slated to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on March 9th.

Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.

We should note that this information falls in line with what Apple analysts such as KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo and Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz have been predicting for months. Supply chain sources who spoke to the press have also said that Apple ramped up their production in late 2014 and entered the mass production stage in December, with the goal of producing enough units for an early-2015 debut.

Apple’s MacBook Air line, which got upgraded in April last year (the only real upgrade being a small speed bump), still features a non-Retina screen with the same screen resolution that hasn’t been updated since late 2010. This is a stark contrast from the rest of the Apple computer lineup, which have been steadily upgraded to a Retina (or at least, a version of it is offered) screen since the first Retina MacBook Pro was unveiled in 2012.

The upcoming Retina MacBook Air, if earlier reports are to be believed, will come in an ultra slim design that combines the productivity of the current larger-screened 13-inch MacBook Air with the portability of the 11-inch MacBook Air.

Internally, the new Retina MacBook Air is said to feature Intel’s next-generation Broadwell Core M low-power processors, which would allow Apple to strip the computer of its fan assembly to create an even thinner profile. Other compromises Apple reportedly made in exchange for a thinner and lighter body includes the full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots.

The Retina MacBook Air, currently codenamed “MacBook Stealth” internally, will also come with a modest price decrease according to previous reports.",last week apple sent invite spring forward event slated held yerba buena center art san francisco march th many expecting apple talk apple watch however source familiar matter within apple exclusively told michael report apple plan unveil long awaited retina macbook air event michael report independently verified information highly credible note information fall line apple analyst kgi security ming chi kuo oppenheimer andrew uerkwitz predicting month supply chain source spoke press also said apple ramped production late entered mass production stage december goal producing enough unit early debut apple macbook air line got upgraded april last year real upgrade small speed bump still feature non retina screen screen resolution updated since late stark contrast rest apple computer lineup steadily upgraded retina least version offered screen since first retina macbook pro unveiled upcoming retina macbook air earlier report believed come ultra slim design combine productivity current larger screened inch macbook air portability inch macbook air internally new retina macbook air said feature intel next generation broadwell core low power processor would allow apple strip computer fan assembly create even thinner profile compromise apple reportedly made exchange thinner lighter body includes full sized usb port magsafe connector sd card slot retina macbook air currently codenamed macbook stealth internally also come modest price decrease according previous report,retina macbook air earlier report believed come ultra slim design combine productivity current larger screened inch macbook air portability inch macbook air internally new retina macbook air said feature intel next generation broadwell core low power processor would allow apple strip computer fan assembly create even thinner profile compromise apple reportedly made exchange thinner lighter body includes full sized usb port magsafe connector sd card slot retina macbook air currently codenamed macbook stealth internally also come modest price decrease according previous report .
1977,"Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded IS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons.

1980,"For its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus follow-up expected to debut in 2015, Apple may introduce a handset with dual lenses in what one well-connected Apple pundit calls the ""biggest camera jump ever.""

On the most recent episode of The Talk Show podcast, Daring Fireball's John Gruber revealed that ""a birdie of a birdie"" told him Apple is working on a two-lens system for incorporation in the next-generation iPhone.

""The specific thing I heard is that next year's camera might be the biggest camera jump ever,"" Gruber said. ""I don't even know what sense this makes, but I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.""

The notion of using multi-lens imaging systems to make up for a smartphone's small form factor is a relatively recent development. In March, HTC unveiled the One M8 with a so-called ""Duo camera"" setup, which uses a secondary imaging sensor for depth data.

An interesting startup called Corephotonics, which was profiled by Engadget earlier this year, proposes a different approach. Corephotonics developed a dual-lens module with two distinct focal lengths, effectively negating resolution drops associated with digital zooming. One camera is used for wide shots, while the other is used for close-ups. As an added bonus, the system provides spatial data for 3D imagery due to its lens offset.

While speculation, Apple could employ a similar system, or even stitch together image data from both camera modules, to achieve DSLR-quality high-resolution photos. The company has no shortage of patents covering smartphone camera technology, including Lytro-like refocusing, interchangeable modules and interchangeable external lenses.

Perhaps most similar to today's rumor is an invention for a multi-sensor system that gathers luminance and chrominance values separately, processes the data and outputs photos at exceptionally high resolutions with equally high color accuracy.",iphone plus follow expected debut apple may introduce handset dual lens one well connected apple pundit call biggest camera jump ever recent episode talk show podcast daring fireball john gruber revealed birdie birdie told apple working two lens system incorporation next generation iphone specific thing heard next year camera might biggest camera jump ever gruber said even know sense make heard kind weird two lens system back camera us two lens somehow take dslr quality imagery notion using multi lens imaging system make smartphone small form factor relatively recent development march htc unveiled one called duo camera setup us secondary imaging sensor depth data interesting startup called corephotonics profiled engadget earlier year proposes different approach corephotonics developed dual lens module two distinct focal length effectively negating resolution drop associated digital zooming one camera used wide shot used close ups added bonus system provides spatial data imagery due lens offset speculation apple could employ similar system even stitch together image data camera module achieve dslr quality high resolution photo company shortage patent covering smartphone camera technology including lytro like refocusing interchangeable module interchangeable external lens perhaps similar today rumor invention multi sensor system gather luminance chrominance value separately process data output photo exceptionally high resolution equally high color accuracy,iphone plus follow expected debut apple may introduce handset dual lens one well connected apple pundit call biggest camera jump ever recent episode talk show podcast daring fireball john gruber revealed birdie birdie told apple working two lens system incorporation next generation iphone specific thing heard next year camera might biggest camera jump ever htc unveiled one called duo camera setup us two lens somehow take dslr quality imagery notion using multi lens imaging system make smartphone small form factor relatively recent development march htc unveiled one called
1986,"The militant Islamic State group has released a video in which it claims to have beheaded the captured American journalist Steven Sotloff, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.

In the video, which lasts for just under three minutes, ISIS murders Sotloff and threatens the life of David Haines, a British citizen.

The video comes weeks after ISIS released a video in which it beheaded another American journalist, James Foley. In that video, the militants threatened to murder Sotloff next if the US bombing of ISIS targets continued.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was in the middle of his daily briefing with journalists when the news broke. He said that the Obama administration would work to confirm the authenticity of the video, adding, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family.""

Sotloff, 31, was kidnapped in 2013 while reporting on the bloody civil war in Syria. He had been a freelancer for outlets such as Time magazine and Foreign Policy.

Recently, the New York Times ran a profile of Sotloff. Friends of his told the paper that he was a ""selfless,"" ""loyal"" and ""caring"" person.

Last week, his mother, Shirley, recorded a video intended for ISIS. She pleaded with the group to be ""merciful"" towards her son.

ISIS is believed to be holding several more journalists in captivity.

1990,"Street harassment is something that happens to women all over the globe. It may begin to occur a lot less in Lima, Peru after an extremely creative Public Service Announcement, which was sponsored by Everlast aired. The video shows what happens when men harass an attractive woman in the street, only to soon find out that the woman is in fact their own mother in disguise. The results are nothing short of hilarious. The video is called Harassing Your Mother.

The host of the video starts out by saying:

“7 out of 10 women are sexually harassed on the streets of Lima, Peru. Men who do it think it is a minor offense. Let’s show them that they are wrong.”

They find “repeating offenders” who harass women on the streets, then proceed to get in contact with their mothers. The moms then get a makeover that makes then look fabulous and not immediately recognizable.

The first man in the video calls out to a woman that he does not know is actually his mother saying (at least according to the translation):



“Tasty panties!”

The mother then turns around and walks up to her son. The realization that he just catcalled his own mother dawns on him as he says, “Mama?”

She then wails on him. She says:

“What’s the matter with you Renzo? What they told me about you is true.”

The man then tries to desperately rationalize the awful thing he did to his mother telling her that it is, “just a game.”

They repeat the prank again one more time in the video, just to cement the idea they are trying to put out. Remember, the next woman you decide to harass on the street may turn out to be your mother, so maybe try not to do it. Okay?

You can watch the video in full, below.

1992,"Charles Manson's fiancée allegedly tricked him into agreeing to marry her as part of a bizarre plot to put his corpse on display after he died.

Afton Elaine Burton, who calls herself 'Star', took out a marriage license with the serial killer last year - but reportedly only suggested matrimony to get legal ownership of his remains and stuff them in a glass coffin.

Star, 27, strung the 80-year-old murderer along with the hope of cashing in after he died and turning his body into a tourist attraction, according to a source close to Manson.

She had already tried to get the rights to his remains without marrying him, but was turned down, according to the New York Post.

The paper claimed that Star offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed, because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands' and wives' bodies after they die.

The claims come from Daniel Simone, a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him.

He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot - and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he's immortal.

Simone told the Post: 'He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool.'

'He feels he will never die... Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.'

Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star - but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran, California.

The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couple's 90-day marriage license had expired.

Killer: Manson is pictured left during his trial in March, 1971, and of right in a mugshot taken on March 18, 2009 at California State Prison, Corcoran

Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend - and last weekend was their final shot before the license expired on 5 February.

Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement, Star has said she an Manson will still marry - but that an 'interruption in logistics' got in the way.

Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanski's actress wife, Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.

Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married.

'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August of the now gray-haired killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead.

She said she had been following Manson's 'philosophy' since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran, where the convicted murderer is detained, to be closer to him.

Manson was married twice before he was jailed, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958, and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963.

1993,"Apple is the sort of company to be so obsessive about the devices they create that they'd make their own type of metal to perfect them. That's what they do. They've already done it. Apple uses cold-forged steel in one iteration of their new Apple Watch. According to Jony Ive, they're also bringing their own specially-prepared gold to the smartwatch as well. Not that this new gold is anything you'd need a new magical alchemy to concoct - this is just a matter of preparation and process.

The Apple Watch comes in several different editions. One of them is called Apple Watch Edition. ""The Edition collection,"" says Apple, ""features six uniquely elegant expressions of Apple Watch."" Apple notes that each of these devices has a watch case crafted from 18-karat gold that they say their metallurgists ""have developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold.""

Jony Ive corroborates this in a story posted by The Financial Times this week. In this story, Ive ""explains how the molecules in Apple gold are closer together, making it twice as hard as standard gold."" That's how hardness works, after all.

As mentioned by Ars Technica's Jonathan M. Gitlin, Apple filed patent application (USPTO) 20140361670 back in June of 2013 for a ""Method and apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite"" which has an abstract which reads as follows:

""A metal matrix composite using as one of the components a precious metal is described. In one embodiment, the precious metal takes the form of gold and the metal matrix composite has a gold mass fraction in accordance with 18 k.""
magic
""The metal matrix composite can be formed by blending a precious metal (e.g., gold) powder and a ceramic powder, forming a mixture that is then compressed within a die having a near net shape of the metal matrix composite. The compressed mixture in the die is then heated to sinter the precious metal and ceramic powder.""
The abstract also contains mention of diamond powder. So don't worry about your fabulous 18k gold being lessened by the likes of peasant materials.

""Other techniques for forming the precious metal matrix composite using HIP, and a diamond powder are also disclosed.""

1994,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +6.68%  on Monday said it plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.

The company will make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by the end of fiscal 2015.

If the division goes off as planned, it would give rise to two publicly traded companies, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.

H-P also boosted the number of its expected layoffs by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying “incremental opportunities for reductions.” H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it has already shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.

A number of big companies, including eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  in tech, have chosen to break up lately, in part because of a belief that operations with different growth profiles are best managed as separate entities. H-P, which has suffered sharp sales declines, sees better long-term potential for its corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit, said one person familiar with the plan.

The impending move, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether the separation could lead to more deal making.

The Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp. EMC +0.49%  , a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P’s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.

The planned breakup is one that Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P and its investors have long contemplated. H-P came close to hiving off its PC operation in 2011, when it announced the ill-fated acquisition of U.K. software company Autonomy Corp. H-P said then it was exploring a separation of its PC business, only to decide two months later to hold on to it amid pressure from shareholders, which led to the departure of then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker.

H-P in 1999 spun off Agilent Technologies, A +1.93%  a maker of electronic-testing gear and other hardware. Agilent subsequently announced plans to break itself up.

In 2012, under current H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman, the company reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation, helping pave the way for the current plan.

Ms. Whitman is slated to be chairman of the PC and printer business, to be known as HP Inc., and CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business.

H-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn’t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.

In the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK +0.68%  , according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but they remain well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached during the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% on Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

In response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as “cloud” software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

The recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—and sometimes actively sought by them.

Last Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

1995,"IBM is preparing to cut more than a quarter of its global workforce in the biggest corporate cull in the computer giant’s history, according to a report.

The US technology giant will slash about 110,000 jobs this week under a plan known internally as “project chrome”, Robert Cringely, a US technology blogger, wrote on Forbes.com.

“To fix its business problems and speed up its ‘transformation’ … about 26% of IBM’s employees will be getting phone calls from their managers. A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork. Project chrome will hit many of the worldwide services operations,” Cringely wrote.

“The USA will be hit hard, but so will other locations. IBM’s contractors can expect regular furloughs in 2015. One in four IBMers reading this column will probably start looking for a new job next week. Those employees will all be gone by the end of February.”

An IBM spokesperson in the UK declined to comment on Cringely’s report.

IBM, known as Big Blue for its once-ubiquitous corporate logo, has struggled to make the transition from manufacturing computers and microchips to the world of cloud computing. Last week, Ginni Rometty, chief executive since 2012, reported quarterly profits below analysts’ forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues.

Annual revenue fell to $93bn (£62bn) last year from $107bn three years earlier as the company shed businesses such as its unprofitable chip design and manufacturing arm. IBM, once an industry pioneer, is still the world’s biggest computer technology company, but it has failed to produce income from consulting, security software and analytics to make up for declining revenues from its old operations.

Cringely predicted big cuts in the workforce at IBM’s US mainframe and storage operation that would damage its ability to serve customers. He alleged project chrome was an accounting exercise to flatter IBM’s results with cost cuts while business disappears from the group’s top line.

IBM’s critics have accused the company of managing its results for years using tax-reduction schemes, outsourcing and non-standard accounting to keep earnings growing. The company last year scrapped a $20-a-share earnings target. The goal was set in 2010, shortly before Warren Buffett decided to invest $10bn in IBM.",ibm preparing cut quarter global workforce biggest corporate cull computer giant history according report u technology giant slash job week plan known internally project chrome robert cringely u technology blogger wrote forbes com fix business problem speed transformation ibm employee getting phone call manager hour later package appear doorstep paperwork project chrome hit many worldwide service operation cringely wrote usa hit hard location ibm contractor expect regular furlough one four ibmers reading column probably start looking new job next week employee gone end february ibm spokesperson uk declined comment cringely report ibm known big blue ubiquitous corporate logo struggled make transition manufacturing computer microchip world cloud computing last week ginni rometty chief executive since reported quarterly profit analyst forecast th straight quarter falling revenue annual revenue fell bn bn last year bn three year earlier company shed business unprofitable chip design manufacturing arm ibm industry pioneer still world biggest computer technology company failed produce income consulting security software analytics make declining revenue old operation cringely predicted big cut workforce ibm u mainframe storage operation would damage ability serve customer alleged project chrome accounting exercise flatter ibm result cost cut business disappears group top line ibm critic accused company managing result year using tax reduction scheme outsourcing non standard accounting keep earnings growing company last year scrapped share earnings target goal set shortly warren buffett decided invest bn ibm,ibm preparing cut quarter global workforce biggest corporate cull computer giant history according report u technology giant slash job week plan known internally project chrome robert cringely u technology blogger wrote forbes column probably start looking new job next week employee gone end february ibm spokesperson uk declined comment cringely report ibm known big blue ubiquitous corporate logo struggled make transition manufacturing computer microchip world cloud computing last week ginni rometty chief executive since reported

1999,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd and the display-making subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will supply screens for Apple Inc's smartwatches, The Electronic Times reported on Monday.

The report, which cited unidentified industry sources, said LG Display will be the sole supplier of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple watches that go on sale in April.

Samsung Display will also become a supplier for the next version of the smartwatch that is expected to go on sale either sometime in the second half of this year or early 2016, the South Korean newspaper said.

LG Display and Samsung Display declined to comment on the report. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

Apple has scheduled a special event on March 9, where it is expected to showcase Apple Watch. The watch, which will let consumers check their email, pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information, represents Apple's first major new product introduction since the 2010 launch of the iPad.

2004,"RAMPUR: All was going well at the wedding ceremony of 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, a resident of Moradabad, and his 23-year-old bride Indira from Rampur. That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.

Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.

The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishore's medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.

Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the ""varmala"" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven ""pheras"".

Meanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.

Kishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used — spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm.

Kishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district, which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO, Milak police station, RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" Solanki said. ""The complaints have been withdrawn.

2006,"The most luxury versions of the smart watch are made of 18-carat gold, expected to cost thousands of pounds and will have their own sales process, like a jewelery store

Apple Stores are to be fitted with new extra-secure safes to look after the luxury edition of the Apple Watch, which is expected to cost thousands of pounds.

The safes will look after the watches before they are sold, as well as housing the demo watches overnight, according to a report by Apple blog 9to5mac. They will also be fitted with chargers to keep the watches ready for demonstrations the next day.

The Apple Watch Edition is the most high-end of the three versions of the Apple Watch, which also include the standard Apple Watch and the lower-priced Apple Watch Sport.

The cheapest Sport is set to cost around £250, but the Edition — which features 18-carat gold — is expected to sell for thousands of pounds.

Because of the high price, the Edition is likely to have its own sales process, according to the report. That is likely to be more similar to that in jewellery stores.

The Apple Watch will be released in April, according to Tim Cook.

Ahead of the launch, the company is also exploring how it can demonstrate the Apple Watch to customers. It is expected that people will be able to try on the watches in Apple’s shops — the ability to use other devices in Apple Stores is often credited with their success.",luxury version smart watch made carat gold expected cost thousand pound sale process like jewelery store apple store fitted new extra secure safe look luxury edition apple watch expected cost thousand pound safe look watch sold well housing demo watch overnight according report apple blog mac also fitted charger keep watch ready demonstration next day apple watch edition high end three version apple watch also include standard apple watch lower priced apple watch sport cheapest sport set cost around edition feature carat gold expected sell thousand pound high price edition likely sale process according report likely similar jewellery store apple watch released april according tim cook ahead launch company also exploring demonstrate apple watch customer expected people able try watch apple shop ability use device apple store often credited success,watch made carat gold expected cost thousand pound sale process like jewelery store apple store fitted new extra secure safe look luxury edition apple watch expected cost thousand pound safe look watch sold well housing demo watch overnight according report apple blog mac also fitted charger keep watch ready demonstration next day apple watch high end three version apple watch also include standard apple watch lower priced apple watch sport cheapest sport set cost around edition feature carat gold expected sell thousand pound high price edition likely sale process according report likely similar jewellery store apple watch released april according to cook
2007,"Reports that the president of Argentina adopted a boy as her godson to prevent him from becoming a werewolf may have been greatly exaggerated.

On December 23, Argentine president Christina Kirchner adopted Yair Tawil, 21, as her godson, as part of a tradition that has been performed in the country for more than 100 years.

Tradition dictates that the president adopts the seventh son or daughter of family as a godchild. That child gets a medal and education up to the age of 21.

Until 2009, the tradition was only available to Catholics, but Tawil was the first Jewish person to be adopted by the Argentine president, according to the Independent.

But what Kirchner described as a ""magical moment"" on Twitter has become a hairy situation thanks to some confusion.

It seems there is another Argentine tradition called ""El Lobison""; a belief that a family's seventh son turns into a werewolf starting on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, and every full moon thereafter, the New York Daily News.

The belief was allegedly so widespread in the 19th century that parents would kill the seventh son to prevent a future teenage werewolf.

It's a great story, but the two customs are not related, according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda.

“The local myth of the lobison is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” Balmaceda told the Guardian.

That detail didn't stop the Independent from blending the two separate customs and reporting that Kirchner adopted Tawil to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Other media outlets, including UPI.com, the New York Daily News, BuzzFeed and HuffPost UK reported that the president adopted Tamir specifically to keep him from becoming a werewolf.

It's probably not true, but Kirchner has not commented on the werewolf confusion, and neither has any werewolf.

2008,"A RESPECTED senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre took his own life mere hours after the horrific attacks stunned the world.

Commissioner Helric Fredou, 45, turned a gun on himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, reported France 3.

A colleague found his body at 1am on Thursday, the day after three gunmen fired at the satirical magazine's office and left 12 people dead.

Speaking to our sister publication Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had taken his own life.


In a statement released after his death, a union spokesman said: ""It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.

""On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.

""The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.

""In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.""

Mr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.

He eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.


French media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.

The attack left 12 people dead. On Friday, the pair were shot dead by police after taking a man hostage at a family-run printing press in Dammartin-en-Goele .

In a separate incident on Friday, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, took about 15 people hostage in a Paris supermarket.

2012,"A letter written by a nine-year-old girl student in support of her teacher who came out as a gay to his class ""brought tears to his eyes.""

9-Year-Old Writes Moving Letter to Teacher Who came Out as Gay
The letter that the 9-year-old wrote to her gay teacher @pinknews, Twitter
After learning that his students felt there was something wrong or bad about being gay or lesbian, the teacher, who is being referred to as ""Mr. R"", decided to reveal his true identity.
According to The Mirror, the girl's full letter reads:
""Dear Mr. R
""Even though you're gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You're a great teacher and these are just some of the word's (sic) that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.
""The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.
?
""You don't have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.
""From A x x
PS. We are all proud of you""
The identity of the girl, the teacher or the school has not been revealed.
Responding to the letter, the teacher said,  ""Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, 'It's just your life'. Then she went back to her maths.""
The teacher, in his interview to Pink News, revealed that during the anti-bullying week, he learnt a very disturbing fact that forced him to come out as a gay to his class.
""As part of anti-bullying week, I'd asked who'd heard 'gay' being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned. Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.""
He consulted the headmaster of the primary school asking for permission to allow him to tell the class about his finacé so as to ""explain when people use that word they're talking about me."" And he said, ""the reaction was fantastic,"" The Independent reports.
The letter written by the young girl was posted on social media. It was praised widely with one person commenting: ""Wouldn't it be lovely if everyone saw things as innocently as this little girl.""",letter written nine year old girl student support teacher came gay class brought tear eye year old writes moving letter teacher came gay letter year old wrote gay teacher pinknews twitter learning student felt something wrong bad gay lesbian teacher referred mr r decided reveal true identity according mirror girl full letter read dear mr r even though gay always treat way still think way used great teacher word sic would describe great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome brave reason say brave shared personal secret brave feel scared know everyone class feel way x x p proud identity girl teacher school revealed responding letter teacher said reading brought tear eye took little compose thanked shrugged repeated something one boy class said lesson life went back math teacher interview pink news revealed anti bullying week learnt disturbing fact forced come gay class part anti bullying week asked heard gay used insult almost every one class put hand stunned asked thought people gay lesbian bad wrong way almost every hand went consulted headmaster primary school asking permission allow tell class finac explain people use word talking said reaction fantastic independent report letter written young girl posted social medium praised widely one person commenting lovely everyone saw thing innocently little girl,girl teacher school revealed responding letter teacher said reading brought tear eye took little compose thanked shrugged repeated something one boy class said lesson life went back math teacher interview pink news revealed anti bullying week learnt disturbing fact forced come gay class part anti bullying week asked heard gay used insult almost every one class put hand stunned asked thought people gay lesbian bad wrong way almost every hand went consulted headmaster primary school asking permission allow tell class finac explain people use word talking said reaction fantastic independent report letter written young girl posted social medium praised widely one person comment

Flight 567 to Portland, Ore., was taxiing to the runway for a 7:50 p.m. departure when the passenger was stung, said Cole Cosgrove, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines.

Woman Stung by a Scorpion on Plane
A woman was stung by a scorpion on her flight from L.A. to Portland Saturday night.

FOR THE RECORD
Feb. 16, 10:29 a.m.: An earlier version of this article identified Cole Cosgrove as a spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines. He is a spokesman for the airline.

The plane returned to the gate and medics checked the woman. She declined additional medical treatment but did not stay on the flight, Cosgrove said.

The woman had brushed the scorpion off of her before  stepping on it. Employees searched the plane and checked the overhead bins but did not find other scorpions, Cosgrove said.

Among the 139 passengers were players and coaches for the Oregon State University men’s basketball team, who tweeted about the scorpion. Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that he sat two rows behind the passenger who was stung.

""The woman was a real champ,” Tinkle said. “She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.

The airline doesn’t know where the scorpion came from, but Cosgrove noted that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico.

2021,"Joan Rivers. Photo: AP

Joan Rivers' personal doctor reportedly took a selfie with the US comedian while she was under general anaesthetic.

The claim was made by a staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic where Rivers underwent a scheduled endoscopy late last month, according to CNN.

The 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest on the operating table and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

The endoscopy procedure was conducted by gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, but CNN cited their source as saying a second doctor entered the room afterwards and performed an unplanned and unauthorised biopsy on Rivers' vocal chords.

That doctor, described only as the comic's personal ear, nose and throat physician, was reportedly not certified by the clinic as required by law.

According to the CNN report, the same source told a state health department investigation into Rivers' death that the doctor first took a selfie with the unconscious star.

They also said the investigators believe Rivers could have suffered the cardiac arrest after the biopsy caused her throat to swell and cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs.

The clinic declined to respond to the comments about a selfie, but last week issued a statement saying ""a biopsy of the vocal cords"" has ever been performed on site.

Patient confidentiality laws prohibited them from specifically referencing Rivers' case.

A couple of days later a spokesperson for the clinic said Dr Cohen was no longer the facility's medical director and was not performing procedures there.

2023,"Debate is raging online as to whether pic shows super-sized snapper of the Kent coast could be the biggest ever to grace UK shores

Is this Britain's biggest crab caught on camera?

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

The 'super crab' picture shows the harbour at Whitstable, Kent. And the unexplained 'creature of the deep' dwarfs fishing boats left on the nearby pier

The pic appeared on the website Weird Whitstable - a collection of the strange put together by Quinton Winter.

Weird Whitstable   Claws for concern: Is this picture shared on the internet the biggest crab the banks of Britain have ever seen?

He told the Daily Express that he saw the mega-crab last summer.

Quinton said: ""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood'.

""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

""Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

The world's largest recorded crab is the Japanese spider crab, a species which can grow to around 12ft and weigh up to three stone.

2026,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

2038,"The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.

Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.

For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.

Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.

The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a ""black hole"" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.

As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.

Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.

Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation.",health focused smartwatch apple initially envisioned one company unveil next month according new report apple original concept apple watch one would track blood pressure heart activity stress level function wall street journal reported monday citing source familiar device none feature make final product due variety issue according journal feature work properly others proved complex would required regulatory approval apple forced scale back range depth health feature first entry smartwatch arena source said due april apple watch enter already crowded playing field competing product samsung sony motorola microsoft lg others thought apple postponed release smartwatch least part perfect health fitness monitoring feature journal source correct feature proved challenging expected example journal reported apple tested sensor measure skin conductivity would helped monitor stress level heart rate sensor ran inconsistency different people hairy arm dry skin result mixed based tightly wore watch according journal source apple also tested way check blood pressure level oxygen blood result inconsistent feature strayed area actually providing medical advice would required approval food drug administration something apple trying avoid difficulty creating smartwatch feature prompted people apple dub project black hole sucked resource one source said result apple touting first smartwatch purpose wearable yes several key health fitness feature available useful especially third party developer create apps tap market apple also busy promoting aspect watch including variety style ability act adjunct iphone support apple pay voice activated control feature apple name convince enough consumer consider apple watch competition december piper jaffray analyst gene munster projected unit sale million wall street forecasting sale million million apple reportedly asked supplier manufacture million million watch first quarter release whether initial sale healthy expected apple certainly come future model could even include health feature pas muster first time around journal source added apple spokeswoman told cnet company declined comment rumor speculation,apple first envisioned one company unveil next month according new report apple original concept apple watch one would track blood pressure heart activity stress level function wall street journal reported monday citing source familiar device none feature make final product due variety issue according journal feature work properly others proved complex would required regulatory approval apple forced scale back range depth health feature first entry smartwatch arena source said due april apple watch enter already crowded playing field competing product samsung sony motorola microsoft lg others thought apple postpone release smartwatch
2040,"THE scourge of ISIS — a female Kurdish warrior who was credited with killing 100 jihadists — may have herself died in the desperate battle to prevent the city of Kobani falling into extremist hands. But her sisters-in-arms fight on.

The young woman, known only by the pseudonym ‘Rehana’, became world famous after a picture of her flashing a “V” for victory sign went viral on social media.

She was part of an unusual movement in the Islamic world: A 10,000 strong, fully female and officially sanctioned militia unit dedicated to defending Kurdish territory.

Most female Peshmerga fighters are trained as snipers.

HOLY EUNUCHS: Do Islamic State jihadists face the ‘big snip?’

The unit was formed in April to combat the Islamic State’s extreme version of Islam which would have women locked up in their houses, only able to leave in the presence of their husbands.

It’s an idea foreign to the Kurdish culture.

“It’s not strange that women are fighting,” Wahida Kushta, an elderly Kobani woman told news organisation AP after preparing the body of a young female fighter for burial. “There is no difference between a lion and a lioness.”

Rehana’s exploits were eagerly followed by pro-Kurdish media, culminating in the boast that she had killed more than 100 Islamic State fighters in the desperate defence of the besieged city.

It was a boast which struck a raw nerve with Islamic State propagandists.

But Rehana is not alone. Reports suggest as many as one-in-three of Kobani’s defenders is a woman.

It’s a struggle that has come at a heavy price.

Recently, ISIS social media propagandists have circulated a gruesome picture purporting to show Rehana’s severed head — complete with long blonde hair — being held aloft in a victory salute by a bearded jihadist.

Pictures and video also have emerged of Kurdish defenders burying female fighters in Kobani. There was no indication Rehana was one of them.

There is no doubt the toll among the female defenders has been high.

The bloody 40-day battle for the city of Kobani has reportedly claimed more than 815 lives. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights today said the death toll includes 21 Kurdish civilians and 302 fighters with the main Kurdish force known as the Peoples Protection Units, or YPG. It said 481 fighters with the Islamic State group have been killed since the battles began.

US aircraft have recently been attempting to assist the resistance fighters, circling above the city in the chance of spotting Islamic State movements.

More than half the city is in jihadist hands, despite recent setbacks.

IS commanders have reportedly pulled troops back from Iraq as a result of the unexpectedly spirited opposition. The jihadists are being assembling them in their Syrian capital Aleppo under the leadership of red-headed Chechen commander Abu Omar al-Shishani. He is expected to lead them in an effort to relieve jihadists fighting in and around Kobane

Al-Shishani had been in command of fighters surrounding the mountains where ethnic Yezidi civilians had fled, sparking an international crisis and relief air-drop campaign.

If Kobani was to collapse under the Islamic State onslaught, the jihadists would gain control of a significant swathe of northern Syria.

ISLAM’S FEMALE FIGHTERS

“I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,” Afshin Kobani, a 28-year-old teacher now fighting on the front lines in Kobani, told AP at the weekend. “This is our land — our own — and if we don’t do it, who else will?”

She is now part of the Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which has an Independent Women’s Battalion (Yekineyen Parastina Jin), or Women Protection Units (YPJ)

Kurdish media states this group of “fearless and effective” women live and fight alongside their male counterparts.

“We are just the same as men; there’s no difference,” Afshin said. “We can do any type of job, including armed mobilisation.”

The unit gained international attention earlier this month when one of its 20-year-old fighters blew herself up as her position on the outskirts of Kobane was overrun, taking up to 20 Islamic State fighters with her.

The battalion, sometimes called “Peshmergettes”, has a fully female chain of command. The detachment of the battalion fighting for the city of Kobane operates under its own female commander, Mayssa Abdo.

“We can say that the Kobani resistance is in particular a women’s resistance,” Abdo recently told Kurdish media group, The Rojava Report. “In order to enter Kobani the ISIS gangs will have to pass over our corpses,”

Fighters in the volunteer force usually do not go under their own names, but instead use pseudonyms.

JIHADISTS FEAR DEATH BY WOMEN?

US Congressman Ed Royce told the US House International Relations Committee that Islamic State militants feared the “Peshmergettes” because they would strip them of their heavenly afterlife.

Fundamentalist jihadists fight believing their martyrdom on the battlefield will be rewarded with 72 virgins upon their arrival in heaven, he said. However, death at the hands of a woman is supposed to strip them of this God-given reward.

“And these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to ISIL and had stopped the advance, turned back the advance — slayed a number of these fighters, who would then run away,” he told the New York Post.

It is a belief the Kurds have been exploiting in their own propaganda campaigns — even though its validity is hotly contested by extremist Islamic scholars.

2050,"Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.""

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.""

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"".

Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.""

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"".

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added.

Hababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.",iraq army shot two british plane carrying weapon isil terrorist al anbar province senior lawmaker disclosed monday iraqi parliament national security defense committee access photo

2057,"Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office.

The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.

The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets.

The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq

‘We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them,’ a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday.

This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq.

The Foreign Office spokesman added: ‘We have a number of sources of information coming in.

‘The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.’

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ‘We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.’ A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

But until now, Jihadi John’s presence at the meeting has not emerged.

It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.

The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present.

Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff

Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left

According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was ‘the one who slaughtered the journalists’.

It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.

IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque’s loudspeakers, appealing for the town’s residents to donate blood at the hospital.

Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.

The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime’s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade.

Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left

Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal

Jihadi John has become one of the world’s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.

Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.

Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS ‘wilayat’, or province.

IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.

Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.

He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured

The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.

In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.

Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to ‘erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere’.

The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday’s attack.

The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader’s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property.

It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured

Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.

He said: ‘A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.’

The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.

It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.

Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.

Also dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document.",jihadi john briton beheaded two british two american hostage held islamic state terrorist

2059,"Brain surgery recovery can be a gamble, but not everybody wakes up in the middle of the procedure. Surgeons don’t yet know exactly how the organ works, so it’s always a risk.

Iga Jasica, a 19-year-old Polish girl, woke up while it was happening and gave the surgeons a surprise. The reason for the surgery was to remove a tumor which had apparently been bothering her for a while. It is suspected that the surgeons may have triggered neurons which caused her to regain consciousness and the ability to hear and speak, but not the senses of sight and feeling.

It was also possible that the doctors had given her the anesthetics incorrectly. Fox News claims that investigators are looking into the reason why Jasica spent part of her brain surgery awake. The surgeons may have simply activated the right neurons despite successful administration of anesthesia.

The surprisingly premature brain surgery recovery is a rare situation, and the surgeons said the first thing she did was ask them, “How’s it going?”

Teenager wakes up while undergoing BRAIN SURGERY in Poland… and asks the surgeons how the… http://t.co/MerFal7GP1 via @MailOnline

— netdog713 (@netdog713) January 3, 2015

Iga Jasica allegedly didn’t appear to wake up in pain, and didn’t sound panicked or frightened. Officials have stated that even though her brain was fully exposed, there was no danger, and her health was not in jeopardy.

The patient reportedly felt so comfortable that as she chatted with the surgeons, Jasica started talking about cats.

After her successful brain surgery recovery, Jasica told the Daily Mail about the experience.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

“I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”

Spending part of brain surgery awake can be a scary situation, but this time everything turned out fine. It even led to an amusing tale of a 19-year-old girl who got rid of a brain tumor and loves cats.

2063,"An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

""I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,"" he said.

2065,"The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime, foreign diplomatic sources believe.

“There was an attempt to force him to go back, but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he hasn’t been found yet,” said the diplomatic source.

The architecture student, referred to only by his surname Han, went missing last month, raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un’s once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Han's father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea’s biggest news agency which broke the story, said: “Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

“If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.”

Han’s curious disappearance, which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal, has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime.

Despite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship, France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship.

Han was studying at Paris’ prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012, along with nine other North Koreans, five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five-year course.

“We didn’t decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea, the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads,” said a head teacher at the La Villette school, who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their “Dear Leader”.

The students are kept under close surveillance, she told The Telegraph.

“There is often an Asian man in a three-piece suit waiting in the courtyard, checking up on attendance and if they get good results,” she said.

“When one failed part of his exam and was sent home, a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that wasn’t possible,” she added.

After long denying its existence, the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a “cooperation programme” involving “students from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris” has been in place for the past decade.

It had no further comment.

The programme was set up by Jean-Noël Juttet, a former French ambassador to Japan, who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of “maintaining contact between the two countries”.

Homing in on education, he said the French suggested courses in “priority sectors, like medicine, food or construction” but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field: architecture.

“That was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing,” he told Street Press, an online news site that first uncovered the student programme.

Trained in France, the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel, the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyang’s skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 330-metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink, dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a “new society of leisure”.

Architecture is not Kim Jong-un’s only area of interest in France. In April, it also emerged that the Emmental-loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese-making at a dairy school in eastern France - reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his country’s attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined.

France has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations, including China. In 2011, it emerged that a French neurosurgeon, Francois-Xavier Roux, had secretly treated Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, in 2008 after he had a stroke.

Describing Kim as apparently ""profoundly Francophile”, Dr Roux said: ""He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that.

""He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux, etc.""

Last month, it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong-un’s feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane.

Behind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy, according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot.

“For North Korea, the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris. It would be a small victory for the country,” he told Street Press.

As for France, he said it was a way of keeping channels of communication open: “You can’t send information to North Korea, so welcoming these young students is a rare opportunity to communicate with the country. In the long term, it could be a way of moving things forward.”

An abduction attempt, however, if confirmed, would “definitively scupper any North Korean request for diplomatic recognition from France,"" he said.",son aide north korean leader kim jong un uncle hiding france evading abduction agent communist regime foreign diplomatic source believe attempt force go back thought escaped somewhere france attempt locate found yet said diplomatic source architecture student referred surname han went missing last month raising concern safety believed son close confidant jang song thaek kim jong un powerful uncle executed december last year treason charge han father known killed recently part kim regime purge jang ally park sung jin paris correspondent yonhap south korea biggest news agency broke story said since regime change someone executed relative friend family studying abroad brought home han returned would likely kept political prison executed happened many time knew awaiting escaped han curious disappearance come amid heightened tension north korea america sony entertainment picture hacking scandal lifted lid murky tie france keep communist regime despite official diplomatic relation dictatorship france behind discreet student programme place since north korean student privileged background study architecture paris stated aim return pyongyang launch grandiose architectural project glory dictatorship han studying paris prestigious ecole nationale superieure architecture de paris la villette left north korea paris along nine north korean five posted another architecture school belleville third year five year course decide blue take student north korea decision made french culture ministry answer head said head teacher la villette school recalled surprise first batch student turned wearing badge effigy dear leader student kept close surveillance told telegraph often asian man three piece suit waiting courtyard checking attendance get good result said one failed part exam sent home representative north korean delegation paris wanted take place explain possible added long denying existence french foreign ministry confirmed telegraph cooperation programme involving student north korea trained architecture paris place past decade comment programme set jean l juttet former french ambassador japan said asked french foreign ministry find way maintaining contact two country homing education said french suggested course priority sector like medicine food construction north korean interested one field architecture request came way top insisted much ended agreeing told street press online news site first uncovered student programme trained france land star architect like jean nouvel student supposed help transform pyongyang skyline new cutting edge architectural design ryugyong hotel metre high edifice completed reportedly behind design new ice skating rink dolphinarium sport centre opened last year help north korea become new society leisure architecture kim jong un area interest france april also emerged emmental loving despot ordered three official attend crash course cheese making dairy school eastern france reportedly dissatisfied country attempt dairy production school politely declined france historically kept relatively warm tie communist nation including china emerged french neurosurgeon francois xavier roux secretly treated kim jong il former north korean leader stroke describing kim apparently profoundly francophile dr roux said wanted establish political tie france hiding also knew french cinema well pretty surprised knew french wine pretty well talking difference bourgogne bordeaux etc last month reported pyongyang flew french surgeon operate kim jong un foot state medium pictured walking cane behind university exchange lie complex game parallel diplomacy according north korea expert pierre rigoulot north korea exchange way legitimising pyongyang regime receiving recognition aim sacrifice anything open embassy paris would small victory country told street press france said way keeping channel communication open send information north korea welcoming young student rare opportunity communicate country long term could way moving thing forward abduction attempt however confirmed would definitively scupper north korean request diplomatic recognition france said,yonhap south korea biggest news agency broke story said since regime change someone executed relative friend family studying abroad brought home han returned would likely kept political prison executed happened many time knew awaiting escaped han curious disappearance come amid heightened tension north korea america sony entertainment picture hacking scandal lifted lid murky tie france keep communist regime behind discreet student programme place since north korean student privileged background study architecture paris stated aim return pyongyang launch grandios
2066,"A French police officer who was in charge of investigating last week’s attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead took his own life after the massacre, French television channel France 3 reported.

Helric Fredou reportedly shot himself on Wednesday in his police office in the west-central city of Limoges with his service weapon.

The 45-year-old commissioner was found dead by one of his colleagues shortly after he had met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

He reportedly killed himself while preparing the report.

According to France 3, the senior police officer suffered from “depression” and “burn out.”

In 2013, Fredou discovered the body of one of his colleagues who had also committed suicide.

Last week, France was in shock following the killing of 12 people in an attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, avowedly in retaliation for the magazine’s defiant stance in publishing cartoons they deemed offensive to Islam.

2071,"A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has made what would be his first public appearance at a mosque in the center of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video. There had previously been reports on social media that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would make his first public appearance since his Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant changed its name to the Islamic State and declared him caliph. The Iraqi government denied that the video, which carried Friday's date, was credible. It was also not possible to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording or the date when it was made.

Iraqi officials said Sunday that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS or Islamic State terror group, was wounded in a U.S.-led airstrike on a convoy of militants in Iraq, and a security strategist said the attack killed his close aide.

While Pentagon officials said they cannot confirm whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy that was targeted, Iraq's Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying the ISIS leader had been wounded, according to The Associated Press.

An Iraqi Interior Ministry intelligence official also cited informants within the terror group as saying that the ISIS leader was hit in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province.

Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, a ""very close companion"" of al-Baghdadi and also known as Abu Suja, was killed along with several other members of the ISIS when planes struck the group's convoy on Friday night, Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi security strategist, told The Telegraph.

""He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him [at the time of the attack],"" al-Hashimi was quoted as saying. ""There are more 20 other people were killed in the US air strike but they are not senior in the organization.""

Baghdadi was supposedly an Islamic preacher at the time of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. He later became a militant and was briefly detained by American forces at Camp Bucca, according to Defense Department officials.

Baghdadi, who is in his early 40s and has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, then allegedly met and received training from al-Qaeda operatives, and later became the leader of the ISIS.

The U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes on ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria since August.

On Friday, U.S.-led airstrikes destroyed a convoy of 10 armed trucks in the attacks on a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul.

A Mosul morgue official said about 50 bodies of ISIS militants were brought to the facility after the airstrikes.

The U.S. has now also doubled the number of its troops in Iraq to fight ISIS militants.

While there are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, President Obama Friday authorized Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to send 1,500 more troops to train and assist Iraqi forces in fighting ISIS militants, as was requested by Iraq's government.

ISIS, an al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, now controls large parts of territories in Iraq and Syria, and seeks to form an Islamic emirate in the Levant region through ""jihad.""

ISIS is seen as the most brutal jihadist terror group. According to reports, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, who have been beheaded by ISIS militants, were subjected to severe physical torture, including waterboarding, and a majority of them converted to Islam under duress.",man purported reclusive leader militant islamic state abu bakr al baghdadi made would first public appearance mosque center iraq second city mosul according video recording posted internet july still image taken video previously report social medium abu bakr al baghdadi would make first public appearance since islamic state iraq levant changed name islamic state declared caliph iraqi government denied video carried friday date credible also possible immediately confirm authenticity recording date made iraqi official said sunday abu bakr al baghdadi leader isi islamic state terror group wounded u led airstrike convoy militant iraq security strategist said attack killed close aide pentagon official said confirm whether al baghdadi convoy targeted iraq defense interior ministry issued statement saying isi leader wounded according associated press iraqi interior ministry intelligence official also cited informant within terror group saying isi leader hit town qaim iraq western anbar province auf abdulrahman elefery close companion al baghdadi also known abu suja killed along several member isi plane struck group convoy friday night hisham al hashimi iraqi security strategist told telegraph baghdadi rarely separate reason could possible baghdadi time attack al hashimi quoted saying people killed u air strike senior organization baghdadi supposedly islamic preacher time u invasion iraq later became militant briefly detained american force camp bucca according defense department official baghdadi early million u bounty head allegedly met received training al qaeda operative later became leader isi u led coalition conducting airstrikes isi position iraq syria since august friday u led airstrikes destroyed convoy armed truck attack gathering isi leader near mosul mosul morgue official said body isi militant brought facility airstrikes u also doubled number troop iraq fight isi militant u troop iraq president obama friday authorized defense secretary chuck hagel send troop train assist iraqi force fighting isi militant requested iraq government isi al qaeda offshoot also known isil control large part territory iraq syria seek form islamic emirate levant region jihad isi seen brutal jihadist terror group according report u journalist james foley steven sotloff british aid worker david haines alan henning beheaded isi militant subjected severe physical torture including waterboarding majority converted islam duress,isi islamic state abu bakr al baghdadi made would first public appearance mosque center iraq second city mosul according video recording posted internet july still image taken video previously report social medium abu bakr al baghdadi made would first public appearance mosque center iraq second city mosul according video recording posted internet july still image taken video previously report social medium abu bakr al baghdadi would make first public appearance since isi islam

The Daily Mail reports that Igor Vorozhbitsyn had parked his car and was walking towards his favorite fishing spot when the bear attacked him and began clawing his face and chest, but then his phone rang, playing the annoying crescendo of “baby, baby, baby, baby oooh,” and the bear did what any creature with ears would do when it heard Justin Bieber: it fled.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” he said.

The man, who sustained cuts and bruises on his face and chest and was taken to the hospital after other fisherman found him, said he firmly believes if his phone hadn’t rang he would have been killed, marking the first time in written history that someone has been thankful for Justin Bieber’s existence.

2074,"This letter from a little girl in support of her gay teacher might bring a tear to your eye

A 9-year-old girl gave this heartfelt letter to her teacher after he came out as gay http://t.co/8ZErlBCfuS pic.twitter.com/JFfIRBnX4P— PinkNews (@pinknews) December 15, 2014

This letter of support was given to a primary school teacher by a 9-year-old girl after he came out as gay to his class.

The teacher, known as 'Mr R' decided to come out to his class after learning that the pupils felt there was something wrong or bad about gay and lesbian people.

The full letter reads:

“Dear Mr R

“Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the word’s (sic) that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

“You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

“From A x x

PS. We are all proud of you”

The teacher and school have not been revealed but the teacher gave an interview to Pink News.

He told the website he decided to come out to his class after he learned a worrying fact during anti bullying week:

“As part of anti-bullying week, I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.

He said he felt very moved by the letter and that it bought a tear to his eye.

“Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.

“For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow up, just acceptance.

“Now, I can mention my fiancé as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I’ve had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I’ll keep forever.”",letter little girl support gay teacher might bring tear eye year old girl gave heartfelt letter teacher came gay http co zerlbcfus pic twitter com jffirbnx p pinknews pinknews december letter support given primary school teacher year old girl came gay class teacher known mr r decided come class learning pupil felt something wrong bad gay lesbian people full letter read dear mr r even though gay always treat way still think way used great teacher word sic would describe great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome brave reason say brave shared personal secret brave feel scared know everyone class feel way x x p proud teacher school revealed teacher gave interview pink news told website decided come class learned worrying fact anti bullying week part anti bullying week asked heard gay used insult almost every one class put hand stunned asked thought people gay lesbian bad wrong way almost every hand went said felt moved letter bought tear eye reading brought tear eye took little compose thanked shrugged repeated something one boy class said lesson life went back math class surprise sure something simple easy file away another piece information judgement follow acceptance mention fianc easily teacher class know little better lot letter card year one know keep forever,mr r decided come class learning pupil felt something wrong bad gay lesbian people full letter read dear mr r even though gay always treat way still think way used great teacher word sic would describe great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome brave reason say brave shared personal secret brave feel scared know everyone class feel way x x p proud teacher school revealed teacher gave interview pink news told website decided come class learned worrying fact anti bullying week part anti bullying week asked heard gay used insult almost every one class put hand stunned asked thought people gay lesbian
2082,"Convicted murderer Charles Manson's bride-to-be was reportedly using him for his body.
The 80-year-old convicted murderer and 27-year-old Afton Elizabeth Burton (a.k.a Star) received a marriage license in November and had 90 days to wed. The ceremony was postponed when Manson became ill and had to go to a medical facility.
Now, journalist Daniel Simone, the author of a new book about the killer, told the New York Post that Manson's fiance had a plan to put Manson's corpse on display.
PHOTO GALLERY | 1 of 38 IMAGES
⟨⟩
Along with friend Craig Hammond, Burton reportedly wanted to display Manson's body in a glass crypt, much like Lenin's tomb in Russia. The goal was apparently for the attraction to rake in a ton of money.
That creepy plan aside, Simone says that Manson, 80, never actually wanted to marry her anyway.
FOX 2 News reports that: ""Simone says Burton and Hammond initially wanted Manson to sign papers granting them ownership of his body, but the killer balked at the notion, so the two conceived the idea for Burton to marry Manson. The law in California, where Manson is incarcerated, grants spousal ownership of remains.""
""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool ... Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,"" Simone told The New York Post. ""He feels he will never die,"" Simone said. ""Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with,"" the Post reported.
Burton has not yet commented on her foiled plan. Burton's mother, Melissa Burton, told FOX 2 News that the Post article is not true. ""She is my daughter no matter what is going on in her life. You would love her unconditionally too if she were your child.""
Manson and Burton's wedding was in trouble ever since it was reported last week that their marriage license was set to expire.

On Monday the 2nd, The Associated Press reported that, ""Afton Elaine Burton and the 80-year-old Manson obtained a 90-day marriage license late last year. It expires Thursday, making this past weekend the couple's final opportunity to hold a wedding inside a visiting room at California State Prison, Corcoran. If the wedding is to happen, the couple must register for a new Kings County marriage license.""",convicted murderer charles manson bride reportedly using body year old convicted murderer year old afton elizabeth burton k star received marriage license november day wed ceremony postponed manson became ill go medical facility journalist daniel simone author new book killer told new york post manson fiance plan put manson corpse display photo gallery image along friend craig hammond burton reportedly wanted display manson body glass crypt much like lenin tomb russia goal apparently attraction rake ton money creepy plan aside simone say manson never actually wanted marry anyway fox news report simone say burton hammond initially wanted manson sign paper granting ownership body killer balked notion two conceived idea burton marry manson law california manson incarcerated grant spousal ownership remains finally realized played fool manson never consented wedding first place never simone told new york post feel never die simone said therefore feel stupid idea begin post reported burton yet commented foiled plan burton mother melissa burton told fox news post article true daughter matter going life would love unconditionally child manson burton wedding trouble ever since reported last week marriage license set expire monday nd associated press reported afton elaine burton year old manson obtained day marriage license late last year expires thursday making past weekend couple final opportunity hold wedding inside visiting room california state prison corcoran wedding happen couple must register new king county marriage license,charles manson bride reportedly using body year old convicted murderer year old afton elizabeth burton k star received marriage license november day wed ceremony postponed manson becameill go medical facility journalist daniel simone author new book killer told new york post manson fiance plan put manson corpse display photo gallery image along friend craig hammond burton reportedly wanted display manson body glass crypt much like le

“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave. You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

Got something in your eye? Here’s the backstory:

The teacher told Pink News he had always felt worried about mentioning his sexuality at the school but was prompted to share it during an anti-bullying week initiative.

He said: “I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.”

He says he discussed the matter with the school’s headteacher and they agreed he could tell the class he was gay “so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.”

The letter came some days later, he explained: “Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.”",teacher shared touching note received nine year old student revealed gay written colourful notepaper say dear mr xxx redacted even though gay always treat way still think way used year old girl gave heartfelt letter teacher came gay http co zerlbcfus pic twitter com jffirbnx p pinknews pinknews december great teacher word would describe great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome brave reason say brave shared personal secret brave feel scared know everyone class feel way p proud got something eye backstory teacher told pink news always felt worried mentioning sexuality school prompted share anti bullying week initiative said asked heard gay used insult almost every one class put hand stunned asked thought people gay lesbian bad wrong way almost every hand went say discussed matter school headteacher agreed could tell class gay least knew one gay person hopefully explain people use word talking letter came day later explained reading brought tear eye took little compose thanked shrugged repeated something one boy said lesson life went back math,shared touching note received nine year old student revealed gay written colourful notepaper say dear mr xxx redacted even though gay always treat way still think way used year old girl gave heartfelt letter teacher came gay http co zerlbcfus pic twittercom jffirbnx p pinknews december great teacher word would describe great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome brave reason say brave shared personal secret brave feel scared know everyone class feel way p proud got something eye backstory teacher told pink news always felt worried
2085,"Item: Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher wrote Tuesday that the NHL will expand soon, and that a franchise in Las Vegas is a lock.

Well, we all know about Las Vegas and locks.

Hey, a team in Vegas would be nice because, well, the Seattle Metropolitans are getting ready for their first season in the Western Conference, and Vegas would make 16 teams in the West to balance out the 16 in the East and ...

Oh, wait, you say there's no team in Seattle? But, but, but ... we thought it was getting a franchise this year, too.

Yeah, the crickets are still competing with all the chirping about that, about how the NHL is increasing from 30 ... to 32 ... to 34 ... or more clubs.

Gallagher wrote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has changed his mind about expansion and is now ready to take the plunge — and that he doesn't have to stop at just two teams.

The NHL adding more than two fits historically. This is how the league has operated the past 40-plus years:

1967: Next Six, to join with the Original Six.

1970-74: Six, to continue Western expansion and to compete with the WHA.

1979: Four, as the league absorbed the surviving teams of the dying WHA.

1991-93: Five, as the Sun Belt strategy took hold.

1998-2000: Four, as part of the league's reunion tour (Atlanta, Minnesota, Ohio).

There are enough worthwhile markets outside Seattle and Las Vegas (Quebec City, Kansas City, Toronto, Hamilton, Portland) to go to 36. Also, Bettman and the owners know they can tap an easy revenue stream (aka franchise fees) if they want/need to pad their cash reserves.",item vancouver province columnist tony gallagher wrote tuesday nhl expand soon franchise la vega lock well know la vega lock hey team vega would nice well seattle metropolitan getting ready first season western conference vega would make team west balance east oh wait say team seattle thought getting franchise year yeah cricket still competing chirping nhl increasing club gallagher wrote nhl commissioner gary bettman changed mind expansion ready take plunge stop two team nhl adding two fit historically league operated past plus year next six join original six six continue western expansion compete wha four league absorbed surviving team dying wha five sun belt strategy took hold four part league reunion tour atlanta minnesota ohio enough worthwhile market outside seattle la vega quebec city kansa city toronto hamilton portland go also bettman owner know tap easy revenue stream aka franchise fee want need pad cash reserve,nhl expand soon franchise la vega lock well know la vega lock well know la vega lock well know la vega lock well know la vega lock well know la vega lock well know la vega lock well know la vega would nice well seattle metropolitan getting ready first season western conference vega would make team west balance east oh wait say team seattle thought getting franchise year yeah cricket still competing chirping nh

Melissa has also been told that staff members at Yorkville Endcoscopy revealed a shocking detail to medical investigators looking into Joan’s death — something occurred during the procedure that wasn’t medically related.”

Joan Rivers’ death was unexpected, and learning that she didn’t have to die is perhaps the hardest part. Many people suspect that something out of the ordinary happened when Joan was put under for her procedure, especially since her doctor (Dr. Cohen) parted ways with Yorkville Endoscopy right after the incident with Rivers occurred. Sources say that Melissa Rivers wants to wait until she learns her mother’s cause of death before she takes legal action.

“It was something related to Joan’s personal ear, nose and throat doctor and it wasn’t about the unplanned biopsy she did. Melissa will await the outcome of the official medical investigation and then absolutely file the lawsuits.”

According to CNN, staffers at the clinic revealed that Dr. Cohen took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia. Also, Dr. Cohen reportedly took a biopsy of something that he found during the endoscopy without Rivers’ consent. It very well may have been the biopsy that caused Rivers to stop breathing.

“Investigators believe that Rivers’ vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.”

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Joan was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after a staff member called 911. Despite resuscitation efforts, Rivers was placed on life support when she was admitted to the hospital. There had been so many rumors about Joan “getting better” and “pulling through,” but once Melissa confirmed that her mom was on life support, the public sort of figured that things weren’t improving.

Rivers passed away on Sept. 4 (exactly one week after being admitted to the hospital) after being taken off life support.

2094,"An airstrike has wounded the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to Iraqi officials.

Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or of al-Baghdadi being wounded.

Iraq’s Defence and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without giving further detail.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official said al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting yesterday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s western Anbar province.

The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Neither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi’s apparent injuries.State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a 10 million dollar US (£6.2m) bounty on his head.

Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.

A US-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive.

The Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq’s army and police divisions to fall into disarray.

On Friday, US President Barack Obama authorised the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce.

2095,"Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath?

Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time.

In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza.



And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood.

Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later.

So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza.


Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course.



It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps.

And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be.

According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls.



Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask?

Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads.



The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging.

So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing.",remember crunch cornmeal crust stringy cheese slightly sweeter normal marinara underneath maybe shoved french fry like birthday candle ate crust first style time case child ninety remember well mcdonald pizza like pogs beanie baby disappeared innocence childhood except two magical location ohio west virginia one hero owner kept mcdonald pizza oven burning year later bust gel pen jot direction tell still buy mcdonald pizza neslted bank ohio river along border west virginia sits village pomeroy population census mcdonald located along main street riverbank still pump pizza five minute le course seven half hour drive toronto zero traffic according google map thanks owner greg mill another mcd still get slice ninety kilometre away across state border spencer west virginia also boast mcdonald still lighting pizza fire electrical coil case may according employee judy norman pizza sold started year ago presumably child everywhere enjoyed throughout said location sold pizza yesterday day everyone want pizza day every often get pizza order mill pretty safe call american hero preserving unique pizza immediately reached comment post updated return call whatever actually happened mcdonald pizza ask well starter turned adult palate quite take way kid mcdonald first launched pizza canadian market early tapping growing appetite pizza burger sale dwindled even launched hockey themed tv ad market savoury pie topped billion early according national post article death mcdonald pizza company poured million oven alone across canada moderate success throughout decade drive took remember waiting pizza delivered plastic number top car pizza slowed thing sale dragging oven scrapped mcdonald turned sight gimmicky production like arch deluxe think blame jessica biel becoming thing,mcdonald still lighting pizza fire electrical coil case may according employee judy norman pizza sold started year ago presumably child everywhere enjoyed throughout said location sold pizza yesterday day everyone want pizza day every often get pizza order mill pretty safe call american hero preserving unique pizza immediately reached comment post updated return call whatever actually happened mcdonald pizza ask well starter turned adult palate quite take way kid mcdonald first launched pizza canadian market early tapping growing appetite pizza burger sale dwindled even launched
2099,"iFans can look forward to the much-awaited smartwatch from Apple making its debut this March if analysts' predictions prove true. That's not all: the 12-inch MacBook Air is also gearing up to launch in the first quarter.

According to a research note from Ming-Chi Kuo, analyst with KGI Securities, the Apple Watch will begin shipping by March. Kuo's forecast is in keeping with recent reports that predict the same release date. He also noted that Apple may hold a special event to unveil the details of the smartwatch, whose specifications are not yet clearly known.

Kuo also predicted that Apple will release the new 12-inch MacBook Air in Q1 2015.

The Apple Watch is also anticipated to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter -- that is the first month alone -- in the event that there is a March launch.

According to Kuo, shipments in the range of 4 million to 5 million will be seen by most component suppliers in March. However, a few components may also see low production yields, which could affect the assembly and shipping.

Kuo also forecast that the much-rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display will also ship in the same quarter, which is in synergy with other rumors. A report earlier inJanuary suggested that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, was beefing up production of the notebook to meet the Q1 2015 release deadline. The ultra-thin MacBook Air is rumored to tout a fan-less design and pack in the latest low-power processor from Intel (Core M). It is also expected to boast a high resolution Retina display and may be the first to incorporate the USB Type C connector which is reversible. This may also be used for charging the device.

Per Kuo, MacBook Air sales will likely touch the 6 million units sales mark (for the first three months of 2015), which is an increase from the 5.9 million forecast in Q1 2014.

The analyst sees iPhone shipments touch 61.7 million unit sales in Q1 2015. Kuo also anticipates a drop in demand for the iPad as the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets did not create much of a stir in the holiday season.",ifans look forward much awaited smartwatch apple making debut march analyst prediction prove true inch macbook air also gearing launch first quarter according research note ming chi kuo analyst kgi security apple watch begin shipping march kuo forecast keeping recent report predict release date also noted apple may hold special event unveil detail smartwatch whose specification yet clearly known kuo also predicted apple release new inch macbook air q apple watch also anticipated sell million unit first quarter first month alone event march launch according kuo shipment range million million seen component supplier march however component may also see low production yield could affect assembly shipping kuo also forecast much rumored inch macbook air retina display also ship quarter synergy rumor report earlier injanuary suggested quantum computer apple supplier beefing production notebook meet q release deadline ultra thin macbook air rumored tout fan le design pack latest low power processor intel core also expected boast high resolution retina display may first incorporate usb type c connector reversible may also used charging device per kuo macbook air sale likely touch million unit sale mark first three month increase million forecast q analyst see iphone shipment touch million unit sale q kuo also anticipates drop demand ipad latest ipad air ipad mini tablet create much stir holiday season,ifans look forward much awaited smartwatch apple making debut march analyst prediction prove true inch macbook air also gearing launch first quarter according research note ming chi kuo analyst kgi security apple watch begin shipping march kuo forecast keeping recent report predict release date also noted apple may hold special event unveil detail smartwatch whose specification yet clearly known kuo also predicted apple release new inch macbook air q apple watch also anticipated sell million unit first quarter first month alone event march launch according to kuo shipment range
2100,"The man behind the world famous 50ft Crabzilla spotted lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable has described the furore caused by the colossal crustacean as “a bit of fun”.

Quinton Winter, of Station Road, told KentOnline he was stunned by the amount of coverage the sea monster has clawed after it appeared at his exhibition at the Horsebridge Centre.

Aerial images of the shadowy figure emerged on the artist’s bizarre blog Weird Whitstable – which documents supernatural sightings across the town.

Artist Quinton Winter
This week it was splashed on the Daily Star front page with the story also featuring in worldwide news outlets including Australia, Malaysia and France.

But despite its popularity with the global media, the tale left online readers feeling rather crabby with criticisms it was “juvenile”.

Quinton said: “When I saw the picture I thought I could use it in my exhibition.

“I thought it may have been a sand formation but it looked like a crab to me.

“I’m not trying to lie about anything, it’s just a bit of fun.”

KM Group graphic artist Ashley Austen took a sceptical view of the paranormal find.

Crabzilla was 'spotted' off the coast of WhitstableCrabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water
He said: “The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the artist had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters.”

But Mr Winter said he didn’t think the image would be taken too seriously.

He said: “Sometimes you put stuff out there and no one takes any notice and then sometimes unexpectedly it goes everywhere. It has been a strange reaction.

“I don’t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?” - Quinton Winter
“I don’t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?”

According to Weird Whitstable, Crabzilla surfaced in July last year at a popular crabbing spot after it was spotted by two young boys.

The boys, which included Mr Winter’s son, were blissfully unaware as the crab slipped silently under the water sideways.

According to the Marine Biological Association, the largest species is the Japanese spider crab which can grow up to 3.7m across - the size of a small car.

2101,"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hit Saturday during a meeting with militants, though not much is known

Iraqi authorities announced on Sunday that an air strike wounded Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS).

He was hit Saturday in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s Anbar province during a meeting with militant forces, anonymous Iraqi officials told the Associated Press.

The Defense and Interior Ministries of Iraq said in statements that al-Baghdadi was injured, but they did not elaborate on the injury or the air strike. The Pentagon offered no additional information.

Since al-Baghdadi, thought to be in his early 40s, took over the militants in 2010, he has grown it from a local al-Qaeda branch into a powerful, independent Islamist extremist group.

The U.S. and allied forces began launching air strikes against ISIS targets in September.

2105,"A TRANSGENDER teenager who killed herself after her Christian parents refused to accept her has left a heartbreaking suicide note.

Leelah Alcorn, 16, stepped in front of a tractor trailer on a rural highway a few kilometres from her family home in Kings Mill, Ohio.

Her mother posted a tribute to her child on Facebook using her birth name Joshua and not mentioning the suicide.

However, the teen had published a note hours before her death on her Tumblr account explaining in detail why she had chosen to end her life.

She says that she identified as a girl from the age of four and that when she discovered that she could be transgender at aged 14 she “cried of happiness”.

“After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” she wrote.

Heartbreakingly, her devout Christian mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, refused to accept her desire to identify as a girl.

She wrote: “I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

‘Gay conversion therapy killed my son’

Leelah went on: “If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.”

She was forced by her parents to see a Christian therapist who told her she was selfish and wrong and should seek God’s help. When she didn’t receive her parents’ consent to transition at aged 16 she cried herself to sleep.

She said she turned against her parents, coming out as gay at school but despite positive responses from her friends she continued to be viewed by her mum and dad as “an embarrassment” because she was not “their perfect little straight christian boy (sic)”.

Writing about her reasons for suicide she said: “I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out.”

She ended the note: “My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.”

In a short Facebook tribute Carla Wood Alcorn ignored her child’s female persona, calling her Joshua and saying she had gone “home to heaven” after she was hit by a truck during “an early morning walk”.

2107,"Christina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.

In Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend:

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

In Guaraní mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters.

In addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing.",christina fern ndez de kirchner president argentina got new addition family last week adopted year old jewish boy named yair tawil godson independent report motivation based century old legend seventh son transform werewolf argentina werewolf referred el lobison paraguay go name luison brazil called lobisomem independent elaborates south american legend werewolf like creature show true nature first friday boy th birthday legend say turning boy demon midnight every full moon doomed hunt kill returning human form well feeding excrement unbaptized baby flesh recently dead lobison said unnaturally strong able spread curse bite guaran mythology lobison offspring tau evil spirit kerana mortal woman culture believe lobison creature act sort grim reaper whose mere presence mean death soon befall come contact independent explains th century fear creature acute argentina family sometimes murdered seventh son prevent legend coming true attempt stop practice argentinean president began adopting seventh son president insisted would stop curse independent add presidential adoption tradition also extended seventh daughter addition able say president godson tawil receive gold medal enjoy full educational scholarship modern time curse seems aptly described blessing,lobisomem independent elaborates south american legend werewolf like creature show true nature first friday boy th birthday legend say turning boy demon midnight every full moon doomed hunt kill returning human form well feeding excrement unbaptized baby flesh recently dead lobison said unnaturally strong spread curse bite guaran mythology lobison offspring tau evil spirit kerana mortal woman culture believe lobison creature act sort grim reaper whose mere presence mean death soon befall come contact

2110,"The Apple Watch is expected to be the main attraction at next week’s “Spring Forward” event, but according to a new report, the long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air could make a surprise appearance at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.

The sketchy rumor comes from the Michael Report, which claims its sources inside Apple say the company’s long-awaited update to the MacBook Air will be announced March 9.

“Sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.”

Obviously, we can’t verify the accuracy of the report. The Michael Report unearthed full details of the iPad Air 2 before the product’s announcement in October of last year, however, the publication also whiffed on some iPhone 6 launch details, including the name of the iPhone 6 Plus, and the Nexus 6.

We’re not really expecting any hardware other than the Apple Watch at next week’s event, but Cupertino could surprise us. The last time the MacBook Air line was upgraded was April 2014, which was just a small spec bump, so it’s due for an update.

Hardware leaks of the 12-inch MacBook Air have been scarce, although multiple reports have confirmed that Apple is working on the device. The new Retina MacBook Air will supposedly feature a fan-less design made possible by Intel’s next-gen Broadwell processors.

Staff at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest in Poland where she lives, had introduced a male snow owl into her enclosure to offer her company.

However, two days later, her mate was found dead and half-devoured.

Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal said: ‘The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.

‘We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.

‘At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

‘In other words, he wasn’t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.’

2117,"A five-year-old was billed for failing to attend a friend's birthday party - resulting in threats of legal action.

Alex Nash, from Cornwall, was invited to the party just before Christmas.

An invoice for £15.95 was sent by his schoolfriend's mother Julie Lawrence, who said Alex's non-attendance left her out of pocket and his parents had her details to tell her he was not going.

Alex's father Derek said he had been told he would be taken to the small claims court for refusing to pay.

Alex's parents, from Torpoint, had accepted an invitation to the party at a dry ski slope in Plymouth, Devon, just before Christmas.

However, they realised their son was double-booked and due to spend time with his grandparents, which he did.

Analysis: Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent

It is all but impossible that Ms Lawrence will be able to recover the £15.95 party ""no show fee"".

Any claim would be on the basis that a contract had been created, which included a term that a ""no show"" fee would be charged.

However, for there to be a contract, there needs to be an intention to create legal relations. A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child ""guest"" or its parents.

If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a ""no show"" charge.

It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: ""I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'.

His parents said they had no contact information for Ms Lawrence at that time.

They found the invoice in a brown envelope in his schoolbag last week.

Mr Nash said: ""It was a proper invoice with full official details and even her bank details on it.

""I can understand that she's upset about losing money. The money isn't the issue, it's the way she went about trying to get the money from me.

""She didn't treat me like a human being, she treated me like a child and that I should do what she says.""

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Mr Nash said he had been told he was being taken to the small claims court because he was refusing to pay.

The party was held at the Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

In a statement, the centre said: ""We would like all our customers to know that this invoice has nothing to do with Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

""No invoices are ever sent out from the centre to private individuals. This is a disagreement between the two parents involved and the fact that the centre has been named on the invoice is fraudulent.

""When booking a party there is a small deposit to pay on booking, confirmation of numbers and final balance are due 48 hours before the party.

""On the extremely rare occasion that people don't attend parents are generally offered other activities in compensation.""

2119,"The comedienne's doctor reportedly took a selfie with the star before undertaking an unauthorized biopsy, it has been claimed

Joan Rivers' personal doctor took a selfie while the comedian was under anesthesia and the physician was set to perform an unauthorized biopsy, a report has claimed.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

Investigators have been informed of the incident by a member of staff at the clinic, according to the broadcaster, which also claims that gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen finished his work on the star shortly before her unidentified personal physician performed the biopsy.

Rex Features   Dr Lawrence Cohen the Yorkville Endoscopy doctor has been fired since Joan Rivers death - he did not carry out reported biopsy

However, just before performing the procedure, it is claimed that the physician took out his camera to take a picture of himself alongside Joan, who was unconscious at the time.

During the subsequent biopsy, Joan suddenly went into cardiac arrest, with investigators believing that her vocal chords began to swell, thereby cutting off oxygen to her lungs.

Earlier this week, a voice recording emerged of Rivers complaining of trouble with her vocal chords.

She can be heard saying: ""I told [you] I didn't feel good. My voice has been bothering me. I don't know what it is . . . I feel like s***. I'm tired already.""

Getty   Joan passed away a week after rumoured biopsy

Later, she said: ""That's it - I don't feel good.""

The news comes following reports that the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen had stepped down.

ABC News tweeted the news writing: ""Medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy where #JoanRivers went into cardiac arrest is out.

""He is no longer performing procedures at the clinic.""

While US gossip website TMZ reports that sources at the clinic say Dr. Lawrence Cohen - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic - stepped down after the board asked him to do so, but they're not directly blaming him for Joan's death.

A rep from the clinic confirmed he had stepped down from his position as medical director.

The clinic previously denied reports claiming they administered a general anaesthetic and conducted a vocal cord biopsy on the late star.

""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" a spokesperson for the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic said in a statement.

""General anaesthesia has never been administered. The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care. Our anesthesiologists utilise light to moderate sedation.""

According to the unnamed source, the alleged procedure should not be performed outside of a hospital.

Both the State Health Department and the New York City Medical Examiner's Office are still investigating the cause of Joan's death, after failing to determine how she died in a preliminary autopsy.

Her funeral - which took place on Sunday at the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan - featured performances from Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman and The New York City Gay Men's Chorus, and was attended by friends and colleagues including Kelly Osbourne, Whoopi Goldberg and Sarah Jessica Parker.

2131,"No, that is not a joke headline stolen from The Onion. This is actually a thing that happened.

According to The Independent, Argentina's president, President Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy named Yair Tawil as her godson so that he would not turn into a werewolf. It's actually part of a longstanding tradition in the country that dates back to a folk story in the country:

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobison"". The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.
Because some people actually believed this hundreds of years ago, they started killing babies. So, to stop that from happening, presidents starting adopting the seventh born boys of families. The practice was later extended to include girls, too. Now, seventh born children not only get the country's president as their new godparent, they also get a gold medal and a scholarship.

According to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Tawil is also the first Jewish boy to participate in the adoption tradition:

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.

On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvelous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther.""",joke headline stolen onion actually thing happened according independent argentina president president christina fern ndez de kirchner adopted boy named yair tawil godson would turn werewolf actually part longstanding tradition country date back folk story country according argentinian folklore seventh son born family turn feared el lobison werewolf like creature show true nature first friday boy th birthday legend say turning boy demon midnight every full moon doomed hunt kill returning human form well feeding excrement unbaptized baby flesh recently dead lobison said unnaturally strong able spread curse bite people actually believed hundred year ago started killing baby stop happening president starting adopting seventh born boy family practice later extended include girl seventh born child get country president new godparent also get gold medal scholarship according jewish telegraphic agency tawil also first jewish boy participate adoption tradition shlomo nehama tawil parent seven boy wrote letter president asking honor denied year yair wrote letter president citing decree asking designation godson tuesday became first jewish godson president argentina history fernandez received yair parent three brother office lit hanukkah candle together president tweet photo described million twitter follower magical moment marvelous family described yair total sweety mother queen esther,el lobison werewolf like creature show true nature first friday boy th birthday legend say turning boy demon midnight every full moon doomed hunt kill returning human form well feeding excrement unbaptized baby flesh recently dead lobison said unnaturally strong spread curse bite people actually believed hundred year ago started killing baby stop happening president starting adopting seventh born boy family practice later extended include girl seventh born child get country president new godparent also get gold medal scholarship according jewish telegraphic agency t

The Islamic State is harvesting human organs to finance its blood-driven caliphate, according to Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations, urging its Security Council to investigate the issue.

Envoy Mohamed Alhakim called on the 15-member body to look at allegations of organ removal by the Islamic State (formerly ISIS) as bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys were discovered in shallow mass graves.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” the envoy, Mohamed Alhakim, said on Tuesday.


“It is clear they are missing certain parts,” the diplomat also noted, adding that a dozen doctors were executed in in northern Iraq, after allegedly refusing to harvest organs of the ISIS victims.

The Islamic State is guilty of “crimes of genocide” of ethnic groups, Alhakim said.

“These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shi'ite, Sunni, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak or Yazidis,” Iraq’s UN Ambassador said.


After the testimony, the UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, then briefed the Council saying that there are numerous reports to support the claim of organ harvesting, which the envoy says is done by the caliphate to finance its cause.

“It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day,” Mladenov said.

“Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis, most notably the Shi’ite community, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, across the country,” he told the Security Council, specifying that at least 790 people were killed in January in Iraq.

“Equally worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from (Islamic State) control,” he said.


Looking into the source of ISIS funding, Middle East media outlet, Al-Monitor, claimed that foreign doctors were harvesting organs in Mosul in a report last year based on a medical source.

According to the Iraqi doctor providing the information, otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli, there had been an “unusual movement” in clinics in Mosul, where Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but “prohibited from mixing with local doctors.”


The organs, al-Mosuli told Al-Monitor, were coming from kidnapped individuals, or wounded fighters.

“Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs,” the doctor claimed, accusing “specialized mafia” of being involved internationally.

Organ harvesting news comes as the Islamic State jihadists burnt 45 people alive near the town al-Baghdadi in Western Iraq. It also comes in the footsteps of the recent beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and the brutal execution of a Jordanian pilot.",nce war islamic state harvesting human organ finance blood driven caliphate according iraq ambassador united nation urging security council investigate issue envoy mohamed alhakim called member body look allegation organ removal islamic state formerly isi body surgical incision missing kidney discovered shallow mass graf body come examine envoy mohamed alhakim said tuesday clear missing certain part diplomat also noted adding dozen doctor executed northern iraq allegedly refusing harvest organ isi victim islamic state guilty crime genocide ethnic group alhakim said terrorist group desecrated human value committed heinous criminal terrorist act iraqi people whether shi ite sunni christian turkmen shabak yazidis iraq un ambassador said testimony un envoy iraq nikolay mladenov briefed council saying numerous report support claim organ harvesting envoy say done caliphate finance cause clear tactic isi using expand day mladenov said almost daily terrorist attack continue deliberately target iraqi notably shi ite community well ethnic religious minority across country told security council specifying least people killed january iraq equally worrying increasing number report revenge attack committed particularly member sunni community area liberated islamic state control said looking source isi funding middle east medium outlet al monitor claimed foreign doctor harvesting organ mosul report last year based medical source according iraqi doctor providing information otolaryngologist siruwan al mosuli unusual movement clinic mosul arab foreign surgeon hired prohibited mixing local doctor organ al mosuli told al monitor coming kidnapped individual wounded fighter surgery take place within hospital organ quickly transported network specialized trafficking human organ doctor claimed accusing specialized mafia involved internationally organ harvesting news come islamic state jihadist burnt people alive near town al baghdadi western iraq also come footstep recent beheading coptic christian libya brutal execution jordanian pilot,isi body surgical incision missing kidney discovered shallow mass graf body come examine envoy mohamed alhakim said tuesday clear missing certain part diplomat also noted adding dozen doctor executed northern iraq allegedly refusing harvest organ isi victim islamic state guilty crime genocide ethnic group alhakim said terrorist group desecrated human value committed heinous criminal terrorist act iraqi people shabak yazidis iraq un ambassador

2146,"Nowadays, it seems the world is just littered with crises. But one thing we don't have to worry about is ""Crabzilla.""

A photo depicting what appears to be a 50-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in Kent, England, started making the rounds on the Internet earlier this week. The photo was featured on a local curiosities site called Weird Whitstable, and eventually dubbed ""Crabzilla.""

Quinton Winter, who runs the site, told the Daily Express that he'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of Kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws,"" he said.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?"" Winter asks on his website.

Experts say neither.

""The idea of a giant 'crabzilla' would [be] very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax,"" Dr. Verity Nye, Ocean and Earth Science researcher at Southampton University, told the Daily Mail. ""I don't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.""

Spider crabs, the largest known to British waters, grow to about 4 feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where Crabzilla is shown lurking.

2151,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.

According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

2157,"A woman in China chopped off her husband's penis not once, but twice.

After Feng Lung, 30, found out that Fan Lung, 32, was sending racy emails to another woman, she chopped it off, according to the Mirror.

Lung had used Feng's cell phone to send his lover an email, according to the news outlet.

After forgetting to log out of his account, she found the messages, and stormed into the bedroom where her husband was sleeping and allegedly cut off his penis with a pair of scissors.

But the anger for her husband and the father of her five children didn't stop there.

While he was recovering in the hospital, she allegedly snipped it off again after surgeons had reattached it.

She then threw it out the window.

Despite losing a lot of blood, Lung chased his wife outside.

""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,"" a hospital spokesperson said according to the news outlet.

Doctors and police officers failed to find his penis when they searched outside.

Feng Lung is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm, the new outlet reports.

But Fan Lung's lover isn't alarmed that Lung is missing his penis.

A senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre killed himself just hours after the horrific terror attack.

Commissioner Helric Fredou, 45, shot himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, France 3 reported.

His body was found by a colleague at 1am on Thursday, hours after the terror attack at the satirical magazine's office which left 12 people dead.

It has been reported that shortly before committing suicide Commissioner Fredou had met with the family of one of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack massacre.

Speaking to Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had committed suicide.

In a statement released after his death, a spokesman for the union said: ""It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.

""On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.

""The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.

""In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.""

Mr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.

He eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.

French media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.

The attack left 12 people dead. On Friday, the pair were shot dead by police after taking a man hostage at a family-run printing press in Dammartin-en-Goele .

In a separate incident on Friday, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, took about 15 people hostage in a Paris supermarket.

Four hostages were killed in the incident along with Coulibaly.

2160,"A pregnant woman lost her left eye when cops in Ferguson shot out a car window with a bean bag — sending shards of glass flying into her face, it was revealed on Friday.

Dornella Conner said she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were “just riding around and respecting Mike Brown” when they stopped at a gas station in the the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday, KMOV St. Louis reported.

Once at the gas station, Conner said, police confronted the couple.

“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street,” she told the local TV station. “De’Angelas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back.”

But cops are crying foul — they say it was Conner and Lee who were the aggressors during the mayhem after Lee drove the car straight at them, according to KMOV.

That’s when one of the cops fired a specialized bean bag round into the front passenger window, in order to stop the car, police said.

Broken glass went flying into Conner’s face and eyes and she was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors were unable to save her left eye.

“Thanks [to] all my Facebook friends for your support,” she wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “Im blind in my left eye and they took it out because i got [shot] in my face … but thank god that i can see the world.”

Conner also remained optimistic for Thanksgiving, but made it clear that she feels the police should pay for what they did.

“Im soo thankful that im here too spend thanksgiving with my family and my kids even tho im still in pain,” she wrote Thursday. “I will have justices for what they did too me but I happy im alive.”

Conner’s father, Donnell, also called for something to be done for what happened to his daughter.

“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of the situation,” he told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, [but] there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”",pregnant woman lost left eye cop ferguson shot car window bean bag sending shard glass flying face revealed friday dornella conner said boyfriend de angelas lee riding around respecting mike brown stopped gas station block hall ferry early tuesday kmov st louis reported gas station conner said police confronted couple pulled coming towards street told local tv station de angelas trying get away blocked u side front back cop cry foul say conner lee aggressor mayhem lee drove car straight according kmov one cop fired specialized bean bag round front passenger window order stop car police said broken glass went flying conner face eye rushed nearby hospital doctor unable save left eye thanks facebook friend support wrote wednesday facebook im blind left eye took got shot face thank god see world conner also remained optimistic thanksgiving made clear feel police pay im soo thankful im spend thanksgiving family kid even tho im still pain wrote thursday justice happy im alive conner father donnell also called something done happened daughter upset disappointed tactic used trying get control situation told kmov understand tough job understand chaos reason fire upon innocent person sitting vehicle,pregnant woman lost left eye cop ferguson shot car window bean bag sending shard glass flying face revealed friday dornella conner said boyfriend de angelas lee riding around respecting mike brown stopped gas station block hall ferry early tuesday kmov st louis reported gas station conner said police confronted couple pulled coming towards street told local tv station de angelas trying get away blocked u side front back cop cry foul say conner lee aggressor
2169,"Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the maker of the game Minecraft for more than $2 billion, people briefed on the discussions said on Tuesday. The move was intended to ensure that one of the most popular games was available for the computing giant’s family of devices.

The sides still need to work out many details, and a deal could fall through, according to one of these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Acquiring Minecraft would give Microsoft control of an online world that has defied many of the conventions of the modern games business to become a blockbuster success.

Minecraft’s blocky graphics are crude by today’s standards, looking like virtual Lego bricks. But unlike many of the start-ups purchased by big technology companies for billions of dollars, Minecraft is already a lucrative business. This year, Mojang, the privately held Swedish company that makes Minecraft, told The Wall Street Journal that its revenue was about $360 million last year, up 38 percent from the year before. The Journal reported the discussions with Microsoft earlier on Tuesday. Mojang was co-founded by Markus Persson, a 35-year-old programmer and game designer who is better known in the gaming world by his gamer name, Notch. Mr. Persson has said in the past that he did not want to sell the company or take money from outside investors.
In an era when many games, especially for mobile devices, are given away, and derive their profit from the sale of virtual currency and other items, Mojang sells Minecraft the old-fashioned way — by charging people to buy a copy. The price varies depending on what kind of device people use to play the game, ranging from $7 on mobile phones to $27 for computer versions. A version of Minecraft for Microsoft’s Xbox, which has been a top seller for the console, costs $20.

For Microsoft, the interest in a deal is motivated in large part by a desire to ensure that attractive content is available for some of its most important platforms. Minecraft is not currently available on Windows Phone, the mobile operating system that Microsoft has struggled to turn into a strong competitor to Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android.

Minecraft has also not been adapted to take advantage of the graphical interface of Microsoft’s latest operating system for computers and tablets, Windows 8. The game is not available for purchase in the Windows Store, Microsoft’s online app store.

Gaming remains one of the most popular applications for mobile devices and computers. The lack of timely versions of top titles for its devices has been a problem for Microsoft as it tries to compete more aggressively with rivals like Apple, Samsung and Google.
By the standards of Microsoft, which had nearly $86 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of June, a $2 billion-plus deal would be relatively small. Because Mojang is a European company, Microsoft would be able to use cash from overseas operations to fund the deal, a more attractive prospect than bringing the cash back to the United States where it would be subject to hefty repatriation taxes.

A spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment. Mr. Persson did not respond to a request for comment.

Microsoft first approached Mojang about three months ago, interested in pursuing a deal, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. By that point, the company — and Mr. Persson in particular — had considered a sale, having received takeover approaches worth about $1 billion in the last few years.

Soon after, Microsoft made an initial offer, prompting more serious talks between the sides. Last month, Mojang hired additional advisers to assist in the discussions.

Talks are continuing between them, and an agreement could be reached by the end of the month, the person briefed on the discussions said.

While Mr. Persson is said to accept that he may not stay for more than six months if a deal is struck, Mojang is pressing to try to ensure that Microsoft retains its younger developers.

In a Q. and A. hosted on the Internet forum Reddit a year ago, Mr. Persson described growing up relatively poor. After he created the popular game, he wrote, he has earned a huge amount of money that he spends on computers, gaming consoles and traveling. “I might eventually get a driver’s license so I can buy a car,” he added.",microsoft advanced talk acquire maker game minecraft billion people briefed discussion said tuesday move intended ensure one popular game available computing giant family device side still need work many detail deal could fall according one people spoke condition anonymity acquiring minecraft would give microsoft control online world defied many convention modern game business become blockbuster success minecraft blocky graphic crude today standard looking like virtual lego brick unlike many start ups purchased big technology company billion dollar minecraft already lucrative business year mojang privately held swedish company make minecraft told wall street journal revenue million last year percent year journal reported discussion microsoft earlier tuesday mojang co founded markus persson year old programmer game designer better known gaming world gamer name notch mr persson said past want sell company take money outside investor era many game especially mobile device given away derive profit sale virtual currency item mojang sell minecraft old fashioned way charging people buy copy price varies depending kind device people use play game ranging mobile phone computer version version minecraft microsoft xbox top seller console cost microsoft interest deal motivated large part desire ensure attractive content available important platform minecraft currently available window phone mobile operating system microsoft struggled turn strong competitor apple iphone google android minecraft also adapted take advantage graphical interface microsoft latest operating system computer tablet window game available purchase window store microsoft online app store gaming remains one popular application mobile device computer lack timely version top title device problem microsoft try compete aggressively rival like apple samsung google standard microsoft nearly billion cash short term investment end june billion plus deal would relatively small mojang european company microsoft would able use cash overseas operation fund deal attractive prospect bringing cash back united state would subject hefty repatriation tax spokeswoman microsoft declined comment mr persson respond request comment microsoft first approached mojang three month ago interested pursuing deal one people briefed discussion said point company mr persson particular considered sale received takeover approach worth billion last year soon microsoft made initial offer prompting serious talk side last month mojang hired additional adviser assist discussion talk continuing agreement could reached end month person briefed discussion said mr persson said accept may stay six month deal struck mojang pressing try ensure microsoft retains younger developer q hosted internet forum reddit year ago mr persson described growing relatively poor created popular game wrote earned huge amount money spends computer gaming console traveling might eventually get driver license buy car added,mojang co founded markus persson year old programmer game designer better known gaming world gamer name notch mr persson said past want sell company take money outside investor era many game especially mobile device given away derive profit sale virtual currency item mojang sell minecraft billion people briefed discussion said tuesday move intended ensure one popular game available computing giant family device side still need work many detail deal could fall according one people spoke condition anonymity acquiring minecraft billion people briefed discussion
2173,"SEOUL, Feb. 5 (Korea Bizwire) – A powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused an unlikely accident involving a Korean housewife, and required the intervention of a couple of paramedics. On January 3, a woman in her fifties had her hair sucked up into a robot vacuum at her home in the city of Changwon, South Korea.

On the day of the accident, she turned on her robot vacuum as usual, and laid down flat on the floor to rest, leaving the robot to do its job. The robot vacuum came around her relaxing on the floor, and suddenly sucked her hair into its nozzle. The vacuum stopped running one to two minutes after the sudden hair intake.

The startled housewife called 119, Korea’s emergency telephone number. Fortunately, paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, and successfully disjoined her hair from the nozzle. The housewife suffered only minor injuries.

The problematic robot vacuum had a nozzle with a roller inside, which sweeps and vacuums floors. The Changwon Fire Service Headquarters presumed that the vacuum’s sensors identified the woman’s hair as dust.

The likelihood of this type accident occurring is undoubtedly more significant in countries with a “sitting-on-the-floor” culture. Since Koreans love to rest or relax on a toasty, cleanly swept floor, exercising caution on using a robot vacuum is probably a good idea.",seoul feb korea bizwire powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused unlikely accident involving korean housewife required intervention couple paramedic january woman fifty hair sucked robot vacuum home city changwon south korea day accident turned robot vacuum usual laid flat floor rest leaving robot job robot vacuum came around relaxing floor suddenly sucked hair nozzle vacuum stopped running one two minute sudden hair intake startled housewife called korea emergency telephone number fortunately paramedic quickly arrived scene successfully disjoined hair nozzle housewife suffered minor injury problematic robot vacuum nozzle roller inside sweep vacuum floor changwon fire service headquarters presumed vacuum sensor identified woman hair dust likelihood type accident occurring undoubtedly significant country sitting floor culture since korean love rest relax toasty cleanly swept floor exercising caution using robot vacuum probably good idea,korea bizwire powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused unlikely accident involving korean housewife required intervention couple paramedic january woman fifty hair sucked robot vacuum home city changwon south korea day accident turned robot vacuum usual laid flat floor rest leaving robot job robot vacuum came around relaxing floor suddenly sucked hair nozzle vacuum stopped running one minute sudden hair intake startled housewife called korea emergency telephone number fortunately paramedic quickly arrived scene successfully disjoined hair
2179,"If you're an American and you've been watching the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong closely, you may have noticed something familiar: a number of the young demonstrators are using the same ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that became a symbol of last month's protests in faraway Ferguson, Missouri.


Hong Kong's protesters have good reason to put their hands up: police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations, which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far, the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently, and that anxiety is showing in these photos.


It's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally. But Hong Kongers, particularly young Hong Kongers, pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use. Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central, named for Hong Kong's Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street.


It's fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.",american watching pro democracy protest hong kong closely may noticed something familiar number young demonstrator using hand shoot gesture became symbol last month protest faraway ferguson missouri hong kong protester good reason put hand police using many observer describe unprecedented level force demonstration rallying chinese government reneging promise grant full democracy injury protest relatively far clash bad enough hong kongers appear earnestly fear police might crack violently anxiety showing photo impossible say degree protester using gesture deliberate nod ferguson borrowing something seen news purpose using coincidentally hong kongers particularly young hong kongers pride plugged world well within realm possibility followed event ferguson appropriating gesture use protester organized within group called occupy central named hong kong central financial district global protest movement began occupy wall street fascinating see symbol fight racism police violence america become symbol democracy freedom halfway around world however got,ferguson missouri hong kong protester good reason put hand police using many observer describe unprecedented level force demonstration rallying chinese government reneging promise grant full democracy injury protest relatively far clash bad enough hong kongers appear earnestly fear police might crack violently anxiety showing photo impossible say degree protester using gesture deliberate nod ferguson borrowing something seen news purpose using coincidentally hong kongers particularly young hong kongers pride plugged world well within realm possibility followed

By the way, the largest known crab in the world is the Japanese spider crab. But even that one only measures up to about one-fourth the size of this alleged “Crabzilla.” They can measure 12 feet across from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds.

2183,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

While another commented, “you’re stupid for doing this. There are other ways to become famous.”

2189,"A five-year-old boy in Torpoint, England, ended up missing a friend’s birthday party, and he did it without any advance notice. Due to his no-show at his friend’s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.

According to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a “child’s party no show fee” invoice for not going to a friend’s birthday party. The bill for £15.95 (approx. $25) was in his son’s school bag last week and Nash “thought it was a joke.”

The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate’s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.

“She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

As the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate’s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.

Upon trying to cancel Alex’s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.

“We did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents.”

It was a week later that the invoice for Alex’s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy’s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.

Alex’s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a “breach of protocol.”

Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy’s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he “would not be paying her the money” and that “she should have spoken to me first.”

The birthday boy’s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.

As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery? He has told his parents that his classmate won’t play with him at school now since he was a no-show to the party and the invoice was given out.

2193,"His gorging has seen him put on so much weight that the tubby tyrant now walks with a limp.

The addicted 31-year-old constantly stuffs his face with the holey Swiss scoff after falling in love with Emmental while he was a student in Switzerland.

A Korean source said: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

This has prompted terrified enemies of the regime who have fled North Korea to claim his poor health is down to his expanding waistline.

Kim was spotted limping at a ceremony in the North Korean capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder, his granddad KimIl-sung.

His face looked swollen and he was limping on his right leg, wearing a gloomy expression through the parade.

And Emmental, which is 45% fat, is said to be sending plump Kim to an early grave.

2194,"UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an alternative acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mladenov said.

Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.

""Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,"" Aburisha told CBS News' Jennifer Janisch.

2195,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors, the Islamic State.

McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administration's counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State, including a plea to Congress to fund anti-Islamic State forces in Syria.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments, and even threatened prosecution.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's our responsibility, to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Ransom payments are prohibited under U.S. law, on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans.

McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families, and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria.

""We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people,"" he said.

In discussing the counter-terrorism plan, McDonough urged Congress to fund anti-Islamic State fighters in Syria, and said the U.S. is ""obviously"" at war with the militant group.

The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage, British aid worker David Haines

The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq.

Obama, McDonough, and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

In his round of interviews, McDonough echoed Obama's pledge to avoid using U.S. combat troops, and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq.

""That's why the Syrian opposition is so important,"" McDonough said on CNN's State of the Union, later adding that ""it's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL.""

On ABC's This Week, McDonough said that ""what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air, but they'll also have training and equipment support from us.""

Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obama's plan, saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is ""delusional"" about its plan.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said. ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion ... It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they're intending to come here.""

Graham also said of Obama: ""This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.""

Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrations's plan, ranging from ""counter-terrorism operations"" to outright ""war.""

On NBC's Meet The Press, McDonough said that ""as much as we've been at war with al Qaeda since we got here, we're at war with ISIL.""

It is ""a complicated effort,"" McDonough said, and ""success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States — an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq, or otherwise.""

Secretary of State John Kerry, who has disputed the use of the term ""war,"" told CBS' Face The Nation that ""there's frankly a kind of tortured debate going on about terminology ... What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL.""",white house chief staff denis mcdonough denying claim administration threatened legal action family kidnapped american paid ransom captor islamic state mcdonough hit series sunday interview show promote administration counterterrorism plan islamic state including plea congress fund anti islamic state force syria family james foley steven sotloff american journalist beheaded islamic state said government objected considered ransom payment even threatened prosecution threaten anybody made clear law mcdonough said fox news sunday responsibility make sure explain law uphold law ransom payment prohibited u law theory would encourage terrorist group kidnap american mcdonough said sympathized foley sotloff family noted administration attempted hostage rescue syria took every effort continue take every effort secure people said discussing counter terrorism plan mcdonough urged congress fund anti islamic state fighter syria said u obviously war militant group interview aired day islamic state beheaded third hostage british aid worker david haines plan obama announced wednesday includes prospect u airstrikes syria expanding ongoing strike neighboring iraq obama mcdonough aide say plan feature assistance local force iraq syria carry fight islamic state also known isil isi round interview mcdonough echoed obama pledge avoid using u combat troop rely force syria iraq syrian opposition important mcdonough said cnn state union later adding going iraqi boot ground bringing fight isil abc week mcdonough said want make sure happens committed partner take fight isil ground support u air also training equipment support u lawmaker analyst questioned obama plan saying united state get involved including prospect ground troop islamic state defeated sen lindsey graham r c told fox news sunday obama administration delusional plan fight graham said fight radical islamic army pushing theory master religion protecting million people throughout world radical islamic army intending come graham also said obama president need rise occasion get killed back home administration official offered different description administration plan ranging counter terrorism operation outright war nbc meet press mcdonough said much war al qaeda since got war isil complicated effort mcdonough said success look like isil longer threatens friend region longer threatens united state isil accumulate follower threaten muslim syria iran iraq otherwise secretary state john kerry disputed use term war told cbs face nation frankly kind tortured debate going terminology focused obviously getting done need get done isil,denis mcdonough denying claim administration threatened legal action family kidnapped american paid ransom captor islamic state mcdonough hit series sunday interview show promote administration counterterrorism plan islamic state mcdonough denis mcdonough denying claim administration threatened legal action family kidnapped american paid ransom captor islamic state mcdonough hit series sunday interview show promote administration counterterrorism plan islamic state mcdonough
2198,"A 17-year-old transgender girl in Ohio committed suicide by walking into traffic early Sunday morning.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that “there’s no way out,” and her concern that she would never fully transition.

Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the  South Lebanon exit of I-71. While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids.

Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.

On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy.

Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me.

As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

2199,"TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.
“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.

Hababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.
The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.",tehran fna iraq army shot two british plane carrying weapon isil terrorist al anbar province senior lawmaker disclosed monday iraqi parliament national security defense committee

None more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland, who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis.

The bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest.

Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate.

But just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead.

Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: ""The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.

""We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.

""At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

""In other words, he wasn’t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.

2216,"Fan Lung’s wife took matters into her own hands after catching Lung sending cell phone messages to his Chinese lover, Zhang Hung, who Lung now plans to marry.

A jilted wife who chopped her cheating husband's manhood off twice is facing jail.

Two-timing dad of five Fan Lung, 32, had used his wife's cell phone to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu, of central China's Henan province.

But after forgetting to log out of his account, stunned wife Feng, 30, came across the message — and several others — and flew into a rage.

Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and snipped his manhood off.

But after being taken to the hospital where he had it sewn back on, fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

“The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,” a hospital spokesman said.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

“He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member, and they believed it may have been stolen by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman said the man had lost a lot of blood and needed emergency surgery.

He is in stable condition but “extremely emotionally distraught,” the spokesman said.

Lung’s lover, who arrived at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

“It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility,” Hung said, “he has five children already.”

2222,"Of all the Apple rumors coming out of the Far East recently, the one with the most legitimacy seems to be Apple producing an iPhone with a 4-inch display next year.

Although the reports are unsubstantiated, returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for Apple.

According to the Electronic Times of Taiwan, the supply chain for Apple production in 2015 includes the components for a smaller handset than the iPhone 6.

The report states that Apple is producing the smaller model “for the convenience of single-handed operation of female users.”

Even though Apple has turned to the larger smartphone and phablet market with the release of the iPhone 5 and 6, respectively, there are still users who prefer the smaller screens and the ability to use a smartphone with just one hand. As phones get bigger, it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands.

The new phone is rumored to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apple’s budget model since its release in September 2013.

The 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model, such as using the Apple 5 model’s A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s, not having Touch ID, lacking the M7 motion co-processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced.

According to Pocketnow, this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small (4-inch), mid-sized (4.7-inch) and phablet (5.5-inch) display. Whether the new 4-inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point.

Apple stayed with a 3.5-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to “get your hands around it.”

2231,"A MAN was saved from a vicious bear attack thanks to his Justin Bieber ringtone.

Russian man Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 41, was walking to his favourite fishing spot when a brown bear attacked him.

As the bear clawed him, Mr Vorozhbitsyn’ mobile phone went off, setting off his ringtone, Justin Beiber’s ‘Baby’, reports The Austrian Times.

At the sound of the hit Beiber track, the bear turned and fled back into the forest.

“I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I’d marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.”

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled.”

“I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,” he said.

Wildlife experts said a sudden noise can frighten animals, even in mid-attack.

“Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” a wildlife experts told The Austrian Times.

After the animal fled Mr Vorozhbitsyn used his phone to call for help.

He suffered cuts and bruises from the attack and is now recovering.",man saved vicious bear attack thanks justin bieber ringtone russian man igor vorozhbitsyn walking favourite fishing spot brown bear attacked bear clawed mr vorozhbitsyn mobile phone went setting ringtone justin beiber baby report austrian time sound hit beiber track bear turned fled back forest parked car walking towards spot marked tremendous impact back bear top believe luck phone went fled know sort ringtone everyone taste granddaughter loaded onto phone joke said wildlife expert said sudden noise frighten animal even mid attack sometimes sharp shock stop angry bear track ringtone would unexpected sound bear wildlife expert told austrian time animal fled mr vorozhbitsyn used phone call help suffered cut bruise attack recovering,man saved vicious bear attack thanks justin bieber ringtone russian man igor vorozhbitsyn walking favourite fishing spot brown bear attacked bear clawed mr vorozhbitsyn mobile phone went setting ringtone justin beiber baby report austrian time sound hit beiber track bear turned fled back forest parked car walking towards spot marked tremendous impact back bear top believe luck phone went fled know sort ringtone everyone taste granddaughter loaded onto phone joke said wildlife expert said
2232,"The British accent in the video that depicted the despicable and cowardly murder of an American journalist has raised concerns in the UK about the background of the ISIS jihadist. The Washington Post’s report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have Americans thinking twice, too:

In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.
The May 2004 Berg killing was conducted by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Tawhid wal-Jihad at the beginning of the 2003 Iraq war, which became al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) at around the time of that beheading. US forces killed Zarqawi in an American airstrike, but AQI survived his death and the Anbar Awakening (if barely) to morph into ISIS when the US pulled out of Iraq. Berg was not the only American beheaded by Zarqawi, either; he also killed Owen Eugene Armstrong later in the same year, and both Berg and Armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered, as did James Foley.

The orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing Guantanamo Bay, but the British seem concerned that there’s more than just symbolism now in play with ISIS. The US began releasing British subjects from Gitmo during the Bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility, as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries, all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight. We’ve seen plenty of recidivism since then, and all to this same end — to rejoin the jihad against the West and the nations in this region, and to recruit others to do the same.

It won’t be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former Gitmo detainee, but it is a bit of a surprise that the UK doesn’t keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately. After all, they have already been identified as threats, picked up in the battle zones far from home, which is how they ended up in Gitmo in the first place. The bigger worry for the UK — and for the US and other Western nations — will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous. It should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger, especially since we’re now desperately looking for ways to roll back ISIS. Perhaps we shouldn’t provide them more fighters than they already have.",british accent video depicted despicable cowardly murder american journalist raised concern uk background isi jihadist washington post report butchery includes nugget american thinking twice interview bbc foreign secretary philip hammond acknowledged apparent executioner spoke british accent said video seemed genuine hundred briton believed traveled syria fight country civil war including many joined islamic state absolutely aware significant number british national involved terrible crime probably commission atrocity hammond said many people may seek point return u k would pose direct threat domestic security european intelligence official said british government examining video speech purported executioner compare former guantanamo bay prisoner british resident believed joined islamic state prisoner video wearing orange shirt pant similar orange jumpsuit worn detainee u military prison guantanamo bay cuba similar outfit believed jihadist symbol prison worn nicholas berg american businessman kidnapped iraq whose execution islamic state precursor organization recorded video posted online may berg killing conducted abu musab al zarqawi leader tawhid wal jihad beginning iraq war became al qaeda iraq aqi around time beheading u force killed zarqawi american airstrike aqi survived death anbar awakening barely morph isi u pulled iraq berg american beheaded zarqawi either also killed owen eugene armstrong later year berg armstrong wore orange jumpsuit murdered james foley orange jumpsuit obviously referencing guantanamo bay british seem concerned symbolism play isi u began releasing british subject gitmo bush administration international pressure shut facility well releasing detainee home country pledged ensure would return fight seen plenty recidivism since end rejoin jihad west nation region recruit others surprise jihadist turn former gitmo detainee bit surprise uk keep close enough watch former detainee account whereabouts immediately already identified threat picked battle zone far home ended gitmo first place bigger worry uk u western nation many butcher make back home undetected anonymous also u taking great care release still present danger especially since desperately looking way roll back isi perhaps provide fighter already,british accent said video seemed genuine hundred briton believed traveled syria fight country civil war including many joined isi islamic state absolutely aware significant number british national involved terrible crime probably commission atrocity . philip hammond acknowledged apparent executioner spoke british accent said video seemed genuine hundred briton believed traveled syria fight country civil war including many joined isi jihadist washington post report butchery includes nugget american thinking

Oh no! Is Hugh Hefner dead? A shocking report went viral on the internet claiming that the Playboy tycoon had passed away of natural causes at his home in the Playboy Mansion. Fans of the 88-year-old celebrity took to Twitter to sound off on their concerns.


Hugh Hefner Dead? New Death Hoax Spread On Internet
Take a huge sigh of relief because Hugh is A-ok!

The businessman made sure everyone know that he was alive and well on Dec. 29.


His wife, Crystal Hefner, also posted a picture of Hugh on the movie night. However, before Hugh’s tweet, fans expressed their worry all over Twitter.


It’s easy to see why fans would be freaking out. A website with the URL “nbctoday.co” posted the story, and it went viral across various social media sites. Many probably assumed that the link was the actual NBC TODAY site.

The site wrote:  “Hugh Hefner, Founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, was found dead of natural causes Sunday morning at his home, the Playboy Mansion, in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to Los Angeles police officer Jimmy N. Gardner. He was 88.”

But Hugh is doing fine. He was just another victim of those crazy death hoaxes that are prevalent on social media nowadays. Good to know you’re OK, Hef!

2239,"Exercise was part of anti-bullying week

A nine-year-old child’s seemingly heartfelt letter to her teacher after he came out as gay to the class has been celebrated by online users.

The unidentified girl apparently wrote the letter to a primary school teacher after he used his own sexuality to explain to his class why homophobia was wrong as part of anti-bullying week.

“I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned,” the unidentified teacher told Pink News.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.”

After speaking to the headmaster of the primary school, the teacher agreed to tell his class about his fiancé in order to “explain when people use that word they’re talking about me.”

He continued: “The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.”

The girl slipped the letter to the teacher shortly after the lesson and he claims that it “brought tears to my eyes”.

Online, users celebrated the letter with one user writing: ""Wouldn't it be lovely if everyone saw things as innocently as this little girl"".

You can read a transcript of the letter below:

Dear Mr R

“Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the word’s [sic] that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

“You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everone [sic] in the class feels the same way as I do.

2244,"The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are two of the more exciting products Apple has unleashed in quite some time. Of the two, differences are slight, but the camera hardware Apple went with on the iPhone 6 Plus is a good reason to stop and consider which you really want. A new rumor suggests those still standing in front of tables at the Apple Store might want to walk away for a few months, as the iPhone 6S camera might end up being even better than the iPhone 6 Plus’.

According to Money.UDN, the iPhone 6S will have a dual-lens camera. We’ve heard similar rumblings before, as Sony announced new camera hardware for mobile devices with a “dual lens”. Sony makes the camera hardware for Apple’s iPhone, so dual lens isn’t so sensational.

Optical zoom, though — that’s interesting. According to Money, the iPhone 6S will have an optical zoom feature, which is something smartphones generally slouch on. Rather than rely on digital enhancements, a hardware fix for zoom may be inbound.

As if a cool new camera wasn’t enough, the report also cites supply chain sources on pressure sensors which Apple is said to include on the next iPhone. One sensor will track blood pressure and heart rate, which makes sense for Apple’s HealthKit, but ultimately seems to clumsy for an iPhone.

iphone-6-nfc-820x420-600x307

The second sensor is even more hard to understand. Supply chain sources say that one will be made available for use with a 3D interface. We’ve seen job openings for Apple’s VR initiatives (which are kind of 3D), but it’s early on for anything 3D for an iPhone, and it’s an unlikely aesthetic change for Apple’s iOS. In the wake of iOS 7’s visual update, there’s no way Apple would go full 3D.

Finally, the report suggests Apple is ditching the 16GB iPhone base model for a 32GB version. If that’s true, good on them; it’s overdue.

Much of these rumors seem like foie gras; force-fed from patent filings and other news tidbits. A new camera is likely, and we’re sure Apple is at least entertaining the idea of dropping the underwhelming 16GB model. As for 3D or extra sensors packed into the iPhone 6S, we’re not going to bite on that one.",iphone plus two exciting product apple unleashed quite time two difference slight camera hardware apple went iphone plus good reason stop consider really want new rumor suggests still standing front table apple store might want walk away month iphone camera might end even better iphone plus according money udn iphone dual lens camera heard similar rumbling sony announced new camera hardware mobile device dual lens sony make camera hardware apple iphone dual lens sensational optical zoom though interesting according money iphone optical zoom feature something smartphones generally slouch rather rely digital enhancement hardware fix zoom may inbound cool new camera enough report also cite supply chain source pressure sensor apple said include next iphone one sensor track blood pressure heart rate make sense apple healthkit ultimately seems clumsy iphone iphone nfc x x second sensor even hard understand supply chain source say one made available use interface seen job opening apple vr initiative kind early anything iphone unlikely aesthetic change apple io wake io visual update way apple would go full finally report suggests apple ditching gb iphone base model gb version true good overdue much rumor seem like foie gras force fed patent filing news tidbit new camera likely sure apple least entertaining idea dropping underwhelming gb model extra sensor packed iphone going bite one,apple unleashed quite time two difference slight camera hardware apple went iphone plus good reason stop consider really want new rumor suggests still standing front table apple store might want walk away month iphone camera might end even better iphone plus according to money udn iphone dual lens camera heard similar sony announced new camera hardware mobile device dual lens sony make camera hardware apple iphone dual lens sensational optical zoom though interesting according money iphone optical zoom feature something smartphones generally slouch rather rely digital enhancement hardware fix zoom may inbound cool new camera enough

2253,"ESPN host Chris Fowler was duped by a fake website, MediaMass, because he failed to check his facts.

Fowler reported a series of wrong facts about Japanese tennis star Kei Nishikori, including that he is the world's highest-paid tennis star and has his own vodka line, soccer team and restaurant chain, USA Today reported. In the segment:

""You're looking at the highest paid tennis player in the male side in the world. That might be a surprise to Roger Federer fans, but Nishikori has signed up lots of companies. According to published reports, made about 46 million last year...How's he doing it? He owns Fat Nishikori burger restaurant, a football team which is soccer, his own brand of vodka, he's got a perfume, he's got a clothing line...He's got a whole lot of deals with Japanese companies.""



Despite Fowler's claim, Deadspin reported, citing Forbes magazine, that Nishikori didn't make $46 million last year but just $11 million, which ""makes him the ninth-highest paid player -- not the richest."" Forbes breaks that down as $9 million in endorsements and $2 million in prize money.

The satire site, Media Mass, had reported that Nishikori was the top paid player making $46 million, based on the (fictional) People with Money magazine.

""He owes his fortune to smart stock investments, substantial property holdings, lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics. He also owns several restaurants (the “Fat Nishikori Burger” chain) in Tokyo, a Football Team (the “Matsue Angels”), has launched his own brand of Vodka (Pure Wondernishikori - Japan), and is tackling the juniors market with a top-selling perfume (With Love from Kei) and a fashion line called “Kei Nishikori Seduction,'"" Media Mass reported.

Within the article, however, in red letters, was a note saying the story was false, linking to a 2012 page describing Media Mass's project. The update, which iMediaEthics highlighted below, says it was posted Jan. 25, 2015, but it was posted when iMediaEthics viewed the story Jan. 24, so we are unsure when it was published.




That update linked to a page on Media Mass' website. ""The website mediamass.net is the medium of our satire to expose with humour, exaggeration and ridicule the contemporary mass production and mass consumption that we observe,"" Media Mass' website states.

In ESPN's defense,  USA Today noted, ""None of the information was completely absurd — it’s not as if they said he owned four castles or slept upside down in a hyperbaric chamber or plans on being one of those people who want to take a one-way trip to Mars.""

Fowler apologized for the error on Twitter, Sports Grid noted.

2258,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Looks familiar: A three-breasted woman makes an appearance in 1990's Total Recall

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

2259,"The despot is putting on the pounds with the Swiss cheese, according to reports, possible because being fat is considered good in North Korea.

Is a dangerous cheese addiction making Kim Jong-un seriously ill?

North Korea's demented despot dictator is reportedly ballooning in weight after getting hooked on Emmental, a cheese produced in Switzerland.

The 31-year-old is said to be importing huge quantities of the savory Swiss treat — which he first discovered while studying in the European country as a child.

Rumors surrounding his dairy dependence surfaced after he appeared on TV with a swollen face.

He also had a limp during the Pyongyang ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder Kim Il-sung.

Dissidents who have fled the Hermit Kingdom, where millions of citizens are reportedly starving to death, said his increasing weight was affecting his health.

And they claimed he was bulking himself up in a bid to look like his grandfather.

""North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny,"" defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, told the Mirror.

""There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung,"" he added.",despot putting pound swiss cheese according report possible fat considered good north korea dangerous cheese addiction making kim jong un seriously ill north korea demented despot dictator reportedly ballooning weight getting hooked emmental cheese produced switzerland year old said importing huge quantity savory swiss treat first discovered studying european country child rumor surrounding dairy dependence surfaced appeared tv swollen face also limp pyongyang ceremony marking th anniversary death nation founder kim il sung dissident fled hermit kingdom million citizen reportedly starving death said increasing weight affecting health claimed bulking bid look like grandfather north korean think fat good unlike south korean want skinny defector cho myung chul korea institute international economic policy told mirror high chance jong un intentionally gained weight look like il sung added,kim jong un seriously ill north korea demented despot dictator reportedly ballooning weight getting hooked emmental cheese produced switzerland year old said importing huge quantity savory swiss treat first discovered studying european country child rumor surrounding dairy dependence surfaced appeared tv swollen face also limp pyongyang ceremony marking th anniversary death nation founder kim il sung dissident fled hermit kingdom million citizen reportedly starving death
2262,"Raven-Symoné took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show.

The rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him. That site is (according to their own disclaimer) a ""gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only."" I have no idea who in the hell would consider a story about a young girl being drugged and raped ""entertainment"" but there you have the world of the Internet, folks. Snopes debunked this rumor awhile ago, but just in case people still need more proof, Raven-Symoné posted her own response to this on her Instagram page today:

I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!
I'm sorry that she even has to do this. Sites like this are not ""parody"" or ""satire"" sites, OK? They exist strictly to farm clicks by posting fake stories and deliberately manipulate people. (They should never been lumped in the same category as places like The Onion.) They know damn well that they what they're doing, and slapping a ""satire"" label on it shouldn't excuse their vulgarity and cheap ploy for attention.

2270,"After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself ""unattractive to men,"" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.

Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

Last year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading ""I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG"" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

2282,"IS it Crabzilla or Claws? This aerial image of a giant crab lurking at a British resort has become an internet sensation.

People have been flocking to a website to judge for themselves whether this picture shows a huge crustacean in shallow water at a harbour mouth in Kent or is just an elaborate hoax.

Quinton Winter, who collates strange and spooky sightings for his Weird Whitstable website, at first thought the image sent to him by a follower showed an unusual sand formation in the shape of a crab but is now convinced it’s a true monster of the deep.

**CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE CREATURES IN DIGUISE**

He believes he saw the giant lurking close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer in the harbour at Whitstable, which is famed for its oysters.

He said: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The picture appears to show an edible crab, scientific name cancer pagurus, a species commonly found in British water but which normally only grows to 10 inches, weighing six pounds.

The biggest known crab species is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft.",crabzilla claw aerial image giant crab lurking british resort become internet sensation people flocking website judge whether picture show huge crustacean shallow water harbour mouth kent elaborate hoax quinton winter collates strange spooky sighting weird whitstable website first thought image sent follower showed unusual sand formation shape crab convinced true monster deep click see creature diguise belief saw giant lurking close shore took son crabbing last summer harbour whitstable famed oyster said first could see faint movement rose water thought funny looking bit driftwood glazed blank eye stalk swivelling wildly clearly massive crab crushing claw incident thought aerial photo showed odd shaped sand bank know better picture appears show edible crab scientific name cancer pagurus specie commonly found british water normally grows inch weighing six pound biggest known crab specie japanese spider crab measure ft,crabzilla claw aerial image giant crab lurking british resort become internet sensation people flocking website judge whether picture show huge crustacean shallow water harbour mouth kent elaborate hoax quinton winter collates strange spooky sighting weird whitstable website first thought image sent follower showed unusual sand formation shape crab convinced true monster deep click see creature diguise belief saw giant lurking close shore took son crabbing last summer harbour whitstable famed oyster said first could see faint
2285,"(CNN) —Three Afghan soldiers in Massachusetts for training who went missing were found trying to cross the border into Canada, several media outlets reported Monday.
The soldiers told customs agents they were refugees and were trying to cross the Niagara Falls Rainbow Bridge, WCVB reported.

The troops were reported missing after a trip to a shopping mall late Saturday, authorities said. It was the second time in a week that Afghan security trainees in the United States have disappeared.

Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers training with the DEA wandered off during a sightseeing trip to Georgetown, CNN affiliate WJLA reported.

They decided they wanted to stay in the United States, but authorities found them and sent them home.

The three men who went missing in Massachusetts were identified as Afghanistan National Army Soldiers Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar.

They arrived in the United States on Sept.11 for Exercise Regional Cooperation, an annual event, the guard said, and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod.

Troops from six nations are participating in the exercise, which runs through Wednesday and will go on as scheduled, the guard said.

2289,"Updated 5:09 a.m. Wednesday:

U.S. officials say the video showing the beheading of a second U.S. journalist by militants of the Islamic State is authentic. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Wednesday.

Original Post:

An Islamic radical group released a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had threatened Sotloff's life when it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

At the time, the militants said Sotloff's life depended on the actions of the U.S. government, which has been targeting the group with airstrikes to stop its offensive in Iraq.

SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, posted a version of the video showing a man who looks like Sotloff kneeling next to a masked fighter holding a knife.

In his regular briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,"" Earnest said. ""The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff.""

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. would try to authenticate the video quickly.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act,"" she said.

Just last week, Sotloff's mother released an emotional video in which she pleaded with the Islamic State to spare her son's life.

Shirley Sotloff asked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to grant her son amnesty, ""to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad who protected people of the Book.""

According to The Washington Post, Sotloff, 31, was a freelance journalist covering the civil war in Syria when he was captured in 2013. On his Twitter account, Sotloff described himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami,"" whose work has been published in Time and Foreign Policy.

Sotloff's mother said he was ""an honorable man"" who ""has always tried to help the weak.""

The New York Times reports that in the video released today, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for the Obama administration's airstrikes in Iraq.

A masked fighter, the Times reports, appears beside Sotloff saying, ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.""

2291,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

2292,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

2294,"Charles Manson's 27-year-old fiancee reportedly wants to marry him so she can put his corpse on display in a glass crypt.

Journalist Daniel Simone told the New York Post that Afton Elaine Burton, aka Star, and a friend think the crypt would be a money-making draw.

But Simone says Manson doesn't want to be put on display for all eternity.

""He feels he will never die,"" Simone told the Post. ""Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.""

The couple's marriage licence expired Feb. 5, but on her website Burton says it will be renewed.

Simone says the marriage idea stemmed from Burton's crypt plan and she initially just wanted Manson to sign over his body to her. If they married, California law states Burton would get possession of the corpse.

Simone told the Post Manson has no interest in a marriage and strung Burton along to continue receiving toiletries and other items.

2298,"The National Security Council says it is ""appalled"" by the apparent beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. ""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.

The NSC's statement came within an hour after ISIL reportedly released a video showing the murder of Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist who had written for Time, Foreign Policy and National Interest. According to the monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group, Sotloff was beheaded in the same manner as James Foley, the photojournalist who was killed last month. The executioner is reportedly the same man who killed Foley and threatened to kill Sotloff in the video released on Aug. 19.

2300,"Three senior Afghan military officers who failed to return to a U.S. training base in Cape Cod have been taken into custody while trying to cross into Canada, according to news reports.

WCVB-TV Boston reports that an unidentified ""high-level law-enforcement source"" told reporter Karen Anderson, that the men were detainedat the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/U.S. border crossing hnear NiagaraFAlls on Monday.

The TV station quotes an unidentified ""high-level law-enforcement source"" for tis reports. The details could not immediately be confirmed.

NBC News, quoting ""top Massachusetts law enforcement officials, also reports the three were detained at the bridge,

The three soldiers from the Afghan National Army arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 11 to take part in a two-week training exercise at Camp Edwards, a National Guard training facility located at Joint Base Cape Cod.

They were last spotted at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, about 20 miles from the base.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday that three officers did not appear to pose a threat to the public and may be trying to defect.

The Cape Cod Times, quoting an unidentified spokesman for the U.S. Central Command that is sponsoring the training exercises, reported Monday that the men were on an off-base chaperoned excursion ""to introduce them to cultural aspects of American life"" when they failed to return to base Saturday night.

Speaking to reporters, Patrick said the U.S. military does not believe the three Afghans pose a danger to the public. He said the military is investigating a number of possibilities, including that they ""might be trying to defect.""

The officers, who were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminy, are among 200 soldiers from Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia taking part in the tactical exercises at Camp Edwards.

The Cape Cod Times quotes military officials as saying base and exercise officials are working with local and state authorities to locate the men.

The U.S. Central Command spokesman tells the newspaper that the three — like all participants in the field exercises — do not have access to weapons.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady tells Boston.com that not all 200 foreign participants are locked down on the base. The officers, who are cleared by the State Department to participate in the program, are permitted to go to dinner or other activities off-base without restrictions.

The camp is a 15,000-acre area inside Joint Base Cape Cod that includes a replica of a forward operating base used by soldiers in places such as Afghanistan, according to the JBCC website.

Sahady said 15 officers and senior enlisted personnel from Afghanistan were taking part in the annual training program, which has been held since 2004. The two-week exercise is scheduled to end Wednesday.

2308,"Bart didn’t have a cat in hell’s chance of coming back from the grave — but after being buried for five days, he clawed his way back.

The miracle feline’s misfortune started when he was struck by a car and his grief-stricken owner laid him to rest.

“The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor’s yard — alive!” the Humane Society of Tampa Bay in Florida told ABC7.com.

The badly hurt, weak and dehydrated kitty dug himself out of the grave and crept back slowly.

Bart needed treatment for facial wounds, a broken jaw and a ruined eye — but his owner couldn’t afford a vet, so he took his pal to the Humane Society.

There is no purrfect ending yet, however, because Bart — who can’t eat due to pain — still has a lot of recovering to do.

He was scheduled to undergo surgery Tuesday to wire his jaw, fix his palette, place a feeding tube and remove his destroyed eye.

Despite the difficult days ahead, the Humane Society expects that Bart will be back home soon — enjoying another of his remaining eight lives.",bart cat hell chance coming back grave buried five day clawed way back miracle feline misfortune started struck car grief stricken owner laid rest cat appeared lifeless owner buried five day later cat showed neighbor yard alive humane society tampa bay florida told abc com badly hurt weak dehydrated kitty dug grave crept back slowly bart needed treatment facial wound broken jaw ruined eye owner afford vet took pal humane society purrfect ending yet however bart eat due pain still lot recovering scheduled undergo surgery tuesday wire jaw fix palette place feeding tube remove destroyed eye despite difficult day ahead humane society expects bart back home soon enjoying another remaining eight life,bart cat hell chance coming back grave buried five day clawed way back miracle feline misfortune started struck car grief stricken owner laid rest cat appeared lifeless owner buried five day later cat showed neighbor yard alive humane society tampa bay florida told abc com badly hurt weak dehydrated kitty dug grave crept back slowly bart needed treatment facial wound broken jaw ruined eye owner afford vet took pal humane society purrfect ending yet however bart eat due pain
2310,"(Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd and the display-making subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will supply screens for Apple Inc's smartwatches, The Electronic Times reported on Monday.

The report, which cited unidentified industry sources, said LG Display will be the sole supplier of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple watches that go on sale in April.

Samsung Display will also become a supplier for the next version of the smartwatch that is expected to go on sale either sometime in the second half of this year or early 2016, the South Korean newspaper said.

LG Display and Samsung Display declined to comment on the report. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

Apple has scheduled a special event on March 9, where it is expected to showcase Apple Watch. The watch, which will let consumers check their email, pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information, represents Apple's first major new product introduction since the 2010 launch of the iPad.

2312,"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise on Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls, sources said Monday.

A top Massachusetts law enforcement officials tells NBC News that the three were caught at the famed Rainbow Bridge.

The three arrived 11 days ago with 200 soldiers and civilians from several countries for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. They were last seen Saturday at a shopping mall in Hyannis during a day off. Massachusetts State Police, with the help of the FBI and the Guard, had been trying to find them.

Col. Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, had told NBC News earlier, ""There's no reason to think they have nefarious intent, and no information to suggest that public safety is in question. But there's a pause for concern, because we want to make sure this wasn't planned, and we want to see if anyone has helped them."" He said because the men have visas that remain valid for the next several days, they're in the country legally.

Several officials say the widely held view is that they were trying to find some way to stay in the country. Gov. Deval Patrick today said publicly what many state and local officials say privately — that they're not considered a danger. Their disappearance follows an apparently similar event last week when two policemen from Afghanistan went missing during a DEA training program in the Washington area. They were found in New York.

Here are the particulars, from The Odessa American:

His father, Jason Steward, said the family had been to see ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" last weekend. His son brought a ring to his class at Kermit Elementary School and told another boy his magic ring could make the boy disappear.

Steward said the principal said threats to another child's safety would not be tolerated – whether magical or not. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the matter.

""All student stuff is confidential,"" Greer said. She referred a call from the Odessa American to Kermit ISD Superintendent Bill Boyd, who did not return a phone call.
The New York Daily News followed up with the Stewards.

2319,"James Foley was courageous, and his murder by an apparently English-accented zealot of the Syria-based Islamic State was so horrific that no simple narrative can do it justice. Unless, that is, you're a conservative political opportunist of a special sort, eager to pin the crime on liberal policies.

The right wing, drunk on a fermenting rotgut of hyperpatriotism and anti-left paranoia, just knows that Foley's murderers were enabled by bleeding hearts and due process. They think they've found proof that Foley's executioner was a prisoner freed from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Maybe it was even Barack Hussein Obama himself who gave the order to free this killer!

Unnamed aggregators at Twitchy, the dittoheads who stare at tweets, were the first to round up grumblings—or perhaps hopes—among right-wingers early Wednesday that Foley's murderer was freed from the detainee pool. These tinfoil hatters took their inspiration from two anonymously sourced paragraphs buried in an early Washington Post report on Foley's murder from Tuesday:

Translation: Flummoxed U.K. intel officials were checking the murder against the usual suspects, hoping to stumble onto a clue in the tiny pool of data they already had before reluctantly wading into the murkier waters of global jihadism. That's standard sleuthing.

And it's sadly unsurprising that the Islamic State's propagandists dressed Foley up in an oversized t-shirt mimicking the infamous orange jumpsuits put on problem detainees at Gitmo; Al Qaeda in Iraq had similarly garbed several of its condemned captives in outfits imitating the jumpsuits—enduring symbols of the mistreatments, real and supposed, of Gitmo inmates.

But to Islamophobic, Gitmo-loving conservatives, these paragraphs could mean so much more:

Presumably, Tsotsoros meant the Bush administration, since it's the one that released all of the 10 British citizens that have been repatriated from Guantanamo, all between 2004 and 2007. And York's choice of ellipses is deceptive, since it implies that the Post was referring to some of those ex-detainees as Syria-based jihadists, when it also was referencing a larger pool of some 800 to 1,500 other British citizens that have traveled to fight for ISIS. (None of the U.K.'s ex-Gitmo inmates is believed to have gone to Syria except Moazzam Begg, who has been in British custody since February on charges related to his travels.)

But never let facts get in the way of a good psychotic B.S. meme. By Wednesday morning, Hot Air's Ed Morrisey was just asking questions, and the game of right-wing telephone was on:

By Wednesday night, the Gitmo link had become ""likely"" on conservative Twitter:

The rumors, like hot sludge on a city street, had trickled down to the lowest internet gutter:

And the rumors mutated into straight-up, demonstrably false partisan bullshit:

And hey, where did the Islamofascists get that orange jumpsuit anyway? Isn't that federal government property? You can't just buy that stuff, right?

Let me reiterate: Whatever hype you may hear, no U.K. Guantanamo detainee released by this administration is responsible for this reprehensible murder, because this administration hasn't released any U.K. detainees from Guantanamo.

Is it remotely possible that one of the 10 Gitmo detainees with British citizenship released by the Bush administration has slipped off into Syria and become an executioner? I don't know the whereabouts of all of them, so I can't say no for sure. But it's astronomically less likely than the possibility that ""Jihadi John,"" as the Brits are calling Foley's presumed killer, is any one of several hundred other disaffected Syria-based zealots with U.K. passports—like, say, this doctor's brother, or any of these idiots, all of them younger than the Gitmo releasees.

About the only thing that's certain is that conservatives—who cleave to simplistic, manichaean narratives like ornery toddlers to security blankets—must have a villain, even if they have to create it.

Justin Bieber’s song has saved a Russian man from being mauled by a bear.

Fishing in the Yakutia Republic, Russia, Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive after his Justin Bieber ringtone, Baby, scared off a bear that was attacking him.

""I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn told the Croatian Times.

Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was walking to his angling spot when a bear ambushed him from behind.

""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said.

But as the bear clawed Vorozhbitsyn’s face and back his mobile phone rang, the ringtone selected was Justin Bieber’s hit song Baby. Rightly startled, the bear retreated back into the forest.

Vorozhbitsyn was able to call for help on his phone and was rescued by fishermen.

Vorozhbitsyn said he has his granddaughter to thank for his ringtone selection.

“I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" he said.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone must have startled the bear enough to halt its attack, reports the Croatian Times.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" an expert said.

2323,"Details surrounding the death of comedian Joan Rivers keep getting more and more suspect.

First there was the report that her personal doctor, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, performed a biopsy on her vocal cords, a procedure experts say should have been performed at a hospital, not an outpatient surgery center such as Yorkville Endoscopy. Rivers reportedly did not consent to the biopsy.

Then it was revealed the clinic doctor who performed Rivers’s endoscopy, gastroenterologist Lawrence Cohen, no longer works for Yorkville. There have been conflicting reports about whether he resigned or was fired. A spokesman for the clinic told The Wrap: “Dr. Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy, nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

And now, an unnamed source claims Rivers’s personal doctor took a selfie while she was under general anesthesia, according to a report by CNN. Rivers’s doctor remains unnamed, and the alleged selfie has not yet surfaced in news reports.

Rivers entered Yorkville Endoscopy in New York City on Aug. 28 for a procedure to determine why she was hoarse and her throat was sore. She stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy and went into cardiac arrest. Rivers was put in a medically induced coma and died at Mount Sinai hospital on Sept. 4 at age 81.

2331,"Production is ""gearing up"" for the upcoming launch of the Apple Watch, according to a fresh report from Digitimes.

Industry sources indicate that as many as 40 million units of Apple's custom chip have been ordered to prepare for initial shipments. These numbers suggest that the Cupertino tech giant is expecting high global demand for its innovative smartwatch.


Along with those high production stats, however, come potentially high prices for consumers. When the Apple Watch was first revealed in September, the base model was announced at a $350 for an aluminum band. This is well over $100 more than similar products from competitors like Sony and Motorola. The ever-looming Apple tax doesn't stop there either.

Apple Watch stainless steel bands could start as high as $500, says French Apple blog iGen.fr, while wealthy buyers hoping to purchase a solid gold band for their Apple smartwatch may have to shell out as much as $5,000. French pricing schemes may vary widely from what we see on day one in the United States, so the accuracy of these figures is still up for debate. Fans of Apple products are used to paying higher prices for premium goods, and that trend seems to be alive and well in the company's latest product.

For those wondering when the Apple Watch hits store shelves, a recent rumor report from Business Insider pegs a release as soon as Valentine's Day 2015. That date is supposedly an optimistic one, however, so officials at Apple are more inclined to stick to a tentative spring 2015 time frame.

As production enters its heaviest phases, Apple seems ready to tackle the watch industry in full force. What remains to be seen, is if the company's first massive chip order will be enough to satisfy consumer demand.

2333,"Playboy boss Hugh Hefner has denied reports that he is dead and said the rumours were 'greatly exaggerated'..

There were recent rumours on the Internet that the 85-year-old had passed away after suffering a heart attack.

A story claimed Playboy magazine would be printed as usual after his death and a Playmate even spoke out about his life.

Love: Hugh Hefner with his then fiancee Crystal Harris who he broke up with just days before his wedding. he has since found a new mate

But soon after the story started to be picked up by several different news outlets, the Playboy founder took to his Twitter page to confirm he is still alive.

He wrote: 'The rumours of my death are, as Mark Twain observed in a similar situation, greatly exaggerated. I'm very much alive & kicking.'

Shera Bechard, 27, French-Canadian model and fledgling actress and now Hef's girlfriend

And to prove how much alive he was, he added: 'I'm lying in bed next to Shera with a big smile on my face, reading tweets about my unexpected demise.'

Shera Bechard is his 24-year-old girlfriend.

Many confused tweeters sent messages about his apparent demise with @WolfesMother writing: 'Weird rumour doing the rounds...Hugh Hefner has gone to the big mansion in the sky?! Prob just a rumour, cause he's immortal right?!'

Moments after his 'death' was reported, the ageing lothario's name was a trending topic on Twitter.

Hefner has not been out of the papers of late, more recently for his very public break up with his former fiancée Crystal Harris shortly before their wedding was due to take place.

Harris cites infidelity on Hefner's part, Hefner said it was the other way around. He has since rebounded with Shera Bechard.

The eternal bachelor did not seem as if he were about to die from heart break however.

He has already replaced Crystal with more than one girlfriend and he has openly spoken of his excitement about watching an upcoming programme about his wedding-that-almost was.

Girlfriends: Hef with Kendra Wilkinson, Bridget Marquardt and Holly Madison while promoting E!'s reality TV show Girls Next Door

After he confirmed that he was still alive, he wrote: 'The guys and I watched an early edit of Hef's Runaway Bride tonight. The fans are going to love it.'

Hefner launched the Playboy empire in 1953 which he financed by selling his furniture and gathering about $8000 from 25 investors.

He has been married twice and has four children. At one point, he had seven girlfriends who all lived in the Playboy mansion with him, spawning the hit E! TV series The Girls Next Door, which starred playmates Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson-Baskett and Bridget Marquardt.

Madison and Wilkinson-Baskett went on to star in Holly's World and Kendra, becoming minor stars of their own.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed, saying he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. intervention.

The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.""

Last week, Sotloff's mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.

""Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,"" she said. ""He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.""

Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist, James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloff's fate depended on what President Barack Obama did next in Iraq.

Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public.

Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff's release for the past year.

Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami.""

In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area.

He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria.",cnn isi terror group published video titled second message america showing beheading american journalist steven sotloff video also threatens life british captive david haines sotloff speaks camera killed saying paying price u intervention masked isi figure video speaks u president barack obama telling missile continue strike people knife continue strike neck people last week sotloff mother shirley sotloff released video pleading isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi kill son steven journalist traveled middle east cover suffering muslim hand tyrant steven loyal generous son brother grandson said honorable man always tried help weak sotloff appeared last month isi video showing decapitation another american journalist james foley militant video warned sotloff fate depended president barack obama next iraq steven sotloff disappeared reporting syria august family kept news secret fearing harm went public public view family number government agency trying gain sotloff release past year sotloff grew south florida mother father younger sister majored journalism university central florida personal facebook page list musician like dave matthew band phish mile davis movie like lawrence arabia big lebowski favorite twitter page playfully identifies stand philosopher miami sotloff left ucf moved back miami area graduated another college began taking arabic class subsequently picked freelance writing work number publication including time foreign policy world affair christian science monitor travel took yemen saudi arabia qatar turkey among country eventually syria,isi terror group published second message america showing beheading american journalist steven sotloff video also threatens life british captive david haines sotloff speaks camera killed saying paying price u intervention masked isi figure video speaks u president barack obama telling missile continue strike people knife continue strike neck people last week sotloff mother shirley sotloff released video pleading isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi kill son
2346,"Path CEO and founder Dave Morin. Is Apple is close to a deal to buy the social networking company Path?

Apple is close to a deal to buy Path, the social networking company that bills itself as ideal for close friends and family, according to the news site Pando Daily, which cited a single unnamed member of Apple's engineering team.

The acquisition report buttressed speculation inspired by the fact that Path co-founder and CEO Dave Morin was in the front row at Apple's big product unveiling event Tuesday and posted a photograph of himself with Dr. Dre,. The rap star is co-founder of Beats by Dre, the headphones maker and music streaming business that Apple bought for $3 billion in August.

Morin declined to comment one way or another onstage at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference Wednesday.

Well known Internet entrepreneur Jason Calcanis, however, commented on Morin's presence in a newsletter he dispatched Tuesday evening saying a deal is plainly on the table.

""Dave Morin was chilling in the first row of the event two seats from Johnny Ive and — I think — next to Dr. Dre. That means one thing and one thing only: Path and the team are going to Apple. You don’t get that first row seat by accident,"" Calcanis wrote.

San Francisco-based Path was founded in 2010 and has raised about $67 million, including a $25 million round disclosed in January. Though featured repeatedly by Apple and lauded for its aesthetic sensibility, its app has struggled in the U.S. marketplace, and Morin acknowledged Tuesday that Path has ""been through a lot of ups and downs.""

He emphasized, however, Path has found significant success in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The Path app now has 5 million daily active users globally, and a separate messaging app the company released in June called Path Talk has more than a million daily active users, he said.

""We've got a vibrant and very happy community,"" Morin said.

Morin also expressed optimism for a new service it is developing that will enable users to message agents who will contact businesses for information and then message users with answers.

Such positive developments follow a tough 2013. That year, Path had layoffs in October and the Federal Trade Commission in February fined the company $800,000 for illegally collecting information about children without their parents consent. Also as part of that trade commission deal, Path settled an FTC complaint that it had downloaded personal information without permission, including contacts, from users' mobile phones.

The company stopped the both practices that were part of the FTC inquiry and apologized.",path ceo founder dave morin apple close deal buy social networking company path apple close deal buy path social networking company bill ideal close friend family according news site pando daily cited single unnamed member apple engineering team acquisition report buttressed speculation inspired fact path co founder ceo dave morin front row apple big product unveiling event tuesday posted photograph dr dre rap star co founder beat dre headphone maker music streaming business apple bought billion august morin declined comment one way another onstage techcrunch disrupt conference wednesday well known internet entrepreneur jason calcanis however commented morin presence newsletter dispatched tuesday evening saying deal plainly table dave morin chilling first row event two seat johnny ive think next dr dre mean one thing one thing path team going apple get first row seat accident calcanis wrote san francisco based path founded raised million including million round disclosed january though featured repeatedly apple lauded aesthetic sensibility app struggled u marketplace morin acknowledged tuesday path lot ups down emphasized however path found significant success southeast asia particularly indonesia path app million daily active user globally separate messaging app company released june called path talk million daily active user said got vibrant happy community morin said morin also expressed optimism new service developing enable user message agent contact business information message user answer positive development follow tough year path layoff october federal trade commission february fined company illegally collecting information child without parent consent also part trade commission deal path settled ftc complaint downloaded personal information without permission including contact user mobile phone company stopped practice part ftc inquiry apologized,founder dave morin apple close deal buy social networking company path apple close deal buy path social networking company bill ideal close friend family according news site pando daily cited single unnamed member apple engineering team acquisition report buttressed speculation inspired fact path co founder ceo dave morin front row apple big product unveiling event tuesday posted photograph dr dre rap star co founder beat dre headphone maker music streaming business apple bought billion august morin declined comment one way another onstage tech
2350,"UNITED NATIONS (CBS News/CBSDC/AP) — Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.
Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.
“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” he said. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.”
He also said a dozen doctors have been “executed” in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.
Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of “crimes of genocide” in targeting certain ethnic groups.
The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.
Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that “it’s very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.” He used an alternative acronym for the group.
He said Iraq’s most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.
“Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,” Mladenov said.
Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.
“Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,” Aburisha told CBS News’ Jennifer Janisch. “We have received promises and we hope that these promises will materialize in reality on the ground.”

2353,"When faced with the choice of feasting on a fine meal of human while listening to Justin Bieber's music or fleeing to blessed — but hungry — quiet, one bear in Russia decided that silence is indeed golden.

A report in the Daily Mail details Russian fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn's unfortunate encounter with the brown bear, who attacked him from behind as he was walking to his favorite fishing spot in the Yakutia Republic. But as the bear was beginning to inflict serious injury on Vorozhbitsyn, his cellphone rang, and the ringtone of Justin Bieber hit ""Baby"" startled the animal, causing it to beat a hasty retreat.

""I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" Vorozhbitsyn said. Nice work, kid — you just saved Grandpa's life with nothing more than a tween anthem.

2355,"Women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up under Saudi Arabia's  latest repressive measure, it was reported yesterday.

The ultra-conservative Islamic state has said it has the right to stop women revealing 'tempting' eyes in public.

A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said a proposal to enshrine the measure in law has been tabled.

'Tempting' eyes: Muslim women could be forced to cover up even their eyes if a 'right' of the Saudi state is enforced

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to wear a long black cloak, called an abaya, cover their hair and, in some regions, conceal their faces while in public.

If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

One report on the Bikya Masr news website suggested the proposal was made after a member of the committee was attracted by a woman’s eyes as he walked along a street, provoking a fight.

The woman was walking with her husband who ended up being stabbed twice in the hand after the altercation.

The virtue and vice committee has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations.

Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.

In 2002, the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in the holy city of Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover.

The decision is thought to have contributed to the high death toll of 15.

They are also banned from driving by religious edict and cannot travel without authorisation from their male guardians.

In September, a Saudi women sentenced to 10 lashes for defying the driving ban was only spared when King Abdullah stepped in to stop the public flogging.

Also in September, the king announced that women would be given the right to vote for the first time and run in the country's 2015 local elections.",woman attractive eye may forced cover saudi arabia latest repressive measure reported yesterday ultra conservative islamic state said right stop woman revealing tempting eye public spokesperson saudi arabia committee promotion virtue prevention vice sheikh motlab al nabet said proposal enshrine measure law tabled tempting eye muslim woman could forced cover even eye right saudi state enforced woman saudi arabia already wear long black cloak called abaya cover hair region conceal face public face punishment including fine public flogging one report bikya masr news website suggested proposal made member committee attracted woman eye walked along street provoking fight woman walking husband ended stabbed twice hand altercation virtue vice committee repeatedly accused human right violation founded function ensure islamic law broken public saudi arabia committee refused allow female student burning school holy city mecca wearing correct head cover decision thought contributed high death toll also banned driving religious edict travel without authorisation male guardian september saudi woman sentenced lash defying driving ban spared king abdullah stepped stop public flogging also september king announced woman would given right vote first time run country local election,woman attractive eye may forced cover saudi arabia latest repressive measure reported yesterday ultra conservative islamic state said right stop woman revealing tempting eye public spokesperson saudi arabia committee promotion virtue prevention vice sheikh motlab al nabet said proposal enshrine measure law tabled tempting eye muslim woman could forced cover even eye right saudi state enforced woman saudi arabia already wear long black cloak called abaya cover hair region conceal face face punishment including fine public
2357,"Rivers, 81, had checked in for routine throat procedure in Manhattan

Slipped into cardiac arrest around 9.40am on August 27

City official revealed how paramedics and other rescues came to her side

More than 10 people helped give her CPR, but couldn't revive the star

Rivers was put into a coma, and died on September 4

The doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers’ vocal cord as she went into cardiac arrest allegedly took a selfie photo with the comedian while she was under anesthetic in the procedure room.

The physician hasn't been publicly identified, but is described as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

A member of staff at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators about the doctor's questionable behavior, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.

Death: Joan Rivers, 81, suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure on August 28

Clinic: Rivers was at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, which made the initial 911 call after she went into cardiac arrest

9:40 a.m, August 27: Yorkville Clinic called 911 with reports of a cardiac arrest.

9:45 a.m: The New York Fire Department response team arrives to find CPR underway, and takes over.

9:47 am: An ambulance from Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, arrives and joins in.

9.48am: A second NYFD unit with Emergency Medical Technicians, along with a supervisor, arrive at the clinic.

9:50 am: By this point the number of rescuers totals ten people.

Details of how emergency services responded to the star's unexpected cardiac arrest at a clinic in New York have emerged, allowing a timeline to be constructed of the cardiac arrest, which proved fatal.

Rivers, 81, had checked in for a routine throat procedure at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28, when her condition took a shocking turn for the worse.

She had to be put of life support, and died on September 4, prompting an outpouring of grief from the world of showbusiness.

Now, almost three weeks after the incident, a New York city official has revealed exactly how the different emergency services fought to save her, and that she was surrounded by rescuers within ten minutes.

The official told CNN that the response began with a 911 call from the clinic, which was given the highest priority.

The fire department were first to arrive at the clinic, five minutes after the call.

Medical staff were already trying to give Rivers CPR using a defibrillator and a breathing tube.

The firefighters then took over the attempts to revive her.

Two minutes after the firefighters came, an ambulance arrived at the clinic, whose paramedics helped with the CPR.

Almost immediately after that, another Fire Department vehicle arrived with medical aid, making a total of more than 10 people fighting to save her.

Rivers was taken from the clinic to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan, where she later died.

New York health authorities have launched an investigation into her death, amid speculation as to the exact nature of the procedure she was undergoing and who was treating her.

A director of the clinic has also resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death.

Loggers Accidentally Cut Down World’s Oldest Tree in Amazon Forest

Illegal loggers at the frontier of the Peruvian and Brazilian border have mistakenly cut down what experts claim is the world’s oldest tree after allegedly not noticing ….




Detailed Analysis


Report Claims World's Oldest Tree Cut Down By Loggers
According to a report that is circulating rapidly via social media and email, illegal loggers working near the Peruvian and Brazilian border have mistakenly cut down the world's oldest tree.

Supposedly, the loggers did not realize they were working in an Amazon Indigenous reserve and cut down a giant Samauma tree that was estimated to be over 5,800 years old.

The story is causing a good deal of angst and outrage as it travels.

Report is Fiction - Comes from Fake-News Site World News Daily Report
However, the claims in the story are untrue. There are no credible reports that support the claims in the message.

The story comes from the fake-news 'satirical' website World News Daily Report.  None of the stories published on the site are valid and its material should not be taken seriously.

The site suggests that its material is 'for entertainment purposes only'.  However, its stories are presented as news articles and there are no clear disclaimers that reveal that the material is fictional.

Thus, many people believe the information published on the site and pass it on in good faith.

The image used in the story was taken from earlier reports discussing deforestation in the Amazon.

Of course, trees can reach quite amazing ages with one spruce tree in Sweden thought to be around 9,550 years old. Other trees around the world are also thousands of years old.

Deforestation is a very serious issue, but spreading nonsensical reports about it will do no good.

Best To Verify Circulating Stories Before Sharing
Many fake-news 'satire' websites have appeared in recent years. Between them, they churn out an endless stream of nonsense, much of which is shared via Facebook and other social media sites.

It is thus wise to verify any 'news' stories that come your way before you share them.

2359,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

2363,"“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

The incident was reported by foreign and alternative media but not mentioned by the establishment media in the U.S. Europe.


Hakem al-Zameli, a senior Iraqi legislator, added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al-Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS.

He said the U.S. wants to promote chaos in Iraq and does this by supporting the Islamic State.

Other Iraqi lawmakers are complaining about the situation.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the al-Ahad news website quoted the head of the al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi, Tarmouz said.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations,” he said.

In December Iranian state media claimed U.S. military aircraft dropped weapons in areas held by the Islamic State for a second time.

Infowars.com reported:

Iraqi volunteers fighting against IS in the Yathrib and Balad districts in Iraq’s Salahuddin Province reported the air drops.

Iraq claims it now has the upper hand in the battle to regain territory from the terrorist group.

In October a purported errant airdrop of weapons fell into the hands Islamic State fighters outside Kobani in Syria.

In November Iraqi intelligence sources said the U.S. is actively supplying ISIS with weapons.

“The Iraqi intelligence sources reiterated that the US military planes have airdropped several aid cargoes for ISIL terrorists to help them resist the siege laid by the Iraqi army, security and popular forces,” a report stated.

“What is important is that the US sends these weapons to only those that cooperate with the Pentagon and this indicates that the US plays a role in arming the ISIL.”
In July, Infowars.com reported on the large amount of U.S. weapons captured by ISIS.

In addition to combat ground vehicles and artillery previously acquired from the Iraqi military, the trove taken form U.S. bases included more than 50 155mm M-198 artillery batteries and 4,000 PKC machine guns.

2366,"A new video appears to show the execution of Steven Sotloff, the second American killed by a self-professed member of the Islamist terror group ISIS.

In the video, which appeared online today, Sotloff addresses the camera, saying, “I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing.”

“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?” the writer says calmly as the black clad militant holds a knife casually at his side.

The video then cuts to the militant who says that as long as U.S. missiles “continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

The camera cuts again and the militant appears to kill Sotloff.

Captured Journalist Steven Sotloff Noted for His Heartfelt War Reporting

Mother of American Hostage Pleads With ISIS 'Caliph' for Mercy

Video Appears to Show Beheading of Journalist James Foley

Last week Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, issued a videotaped plea directly to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, asking him to spare her son.

Sotloff was seen alive last month at the end of a very similar video that appeared to show the execution of American journalist James Foley. In that video, the militant told President Obama that Sotloff’s life was in his hands.

Similarly, today’s video ends with the militant threatening the life of a man identified as David Cawthorne Haines, a British citizen.

According to CNN, the comedian’s personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while Rivers was under anesthesia, and also performed a biopsy on her vocal cords without her prior consent. Yorkville's medical director Lawrence Cohen, who has since been let go from his post, was the one originally performing the endoscopy on Rivers. It is believed Cohen then stepped aside to let Rivers' personal doctor — who was not authorized to practice at the clinic — perform the unauthorized biopsy that ultimately caused her to go into cardiac arrest.

So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.

Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

According to sources who have fled the Communist dictatorship, Jong-Un is ballooning in weight and is even walking with a limp.

In North Korean culture, being fat and overweight is considered a sign of wealth and good luck, hence why it's believed that Jong-Un is bulking up on weight for that very reason.

Others believe it's so that he can look more like his grandfather and found of North Korea, Kim Il-Sung.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

A military historian, and popular Twitter microblogger using the handle @ArmedResearch, is reporting a huge explosion of an oil pipeline belonging to Saudi Aramco near Sudair.

With all eyes on Saudi and crude right now, speculation and conspiracy theories immediately emerged on social media concerning the news. Here are two of the most interesting hypotheses I've seen:

This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production.
The US Elections are over, time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long-tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses.

2382,"The world's werewolf population likely will have one less member to add to its rolls, thanks to the benevolence of Argentine President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner.

Under a law the country has followed since the 1920s to counteract a generations-old legend, Fernandez adopted Yail Tawil, her godson who was destined, as the seventh son of his family, to become a werewolf, according to various published reports and the president's own tweets.

The happy family:

Argentina passed the law because the belief in the curse became so widespread that families were abandoning, putting up for adoption and in some cases killing their seventh sons, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Tawil's parents wrote Fernandez a letter asking her to take on Tawil as her godson, to which she agreed in a ceremony she described to her Twitter followers as ""magical.""

Many media reports described Tawil as a boy, but The Guardian said he's 21.

2383,"Cristina Kirchner, the president of Argentina, has ""adopted"" a Jewish boy in order, according to legend, to prevent him from turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil, 21, was born in the Argentine city of Rosario, the seventh son of Shlomo and Nehama Tawil.

Under Argentine legend – which reportedly originated in Tsarist Russia – any seventh consecutive son will grow up to become a werewolf. Any seventh daughter will become a witch.

The belief in the myth was so strong that, centuries ago, the seventh child was often put to death.

In 1907, in a bid to counter the myth, Jose Figeroa Alcorta, then-president of Argentina, became the godfather of José Brost, the seventh son of a Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann who had emigrated from Russia.

In 1973 President Juan Domingo Perón formalised the tradition of presidents becoming godparents to the seventh son or daughter, and a year later the ruling was enshrined in law. Those affected by law 20.843 – ""The Law of Presidential Godfathership"", were entitled to presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until the 21st birthday.

But the ruling only applied to Catholic families, and so in 1993 Mr and Mrs Tawil wrote to the president asking for the honour to be extended to their son, Yair.

The request was denied. But in 2009 the law was changed to apply to all – regardless of their religion.

And just before Christmas, Mrs Kirchner met with Yair, who became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvellous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther.""

She tweeted that the Tawils ""are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.""

Twitter: Cristina Kirchner - Es una familia muy especial. Tienen como paz, alegría y mucho amor. No es común. Buena vibra. http://t.co/QILUC11xR4

Mrs Kirchner adopted her first ""godson"" in 2008. In 2012 she adopted another, Natanael Eric, who was also born in Rosario, and last year three more boys – all of them born in the northern province of Santa Fe.

The Argentine president had been due to usher in the New Year with a visit to the Vatican, to see her compatriot Pope Francis.

But a fall on Boxing Day, when she slipped on a wet floor in her home, caused her to fracture her ankle.

2392,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”",made headline around world revealed paid thousand dollar get third breast surgically attached chest florida woman jasmine tridevil facing claim surgery fake made claim come american news channel news revealed tridevil go real name alisha jasmine hessler filed incident report losing three breast prosthesis earlier month tridevil filed report bag stolen tampa international airport september report also obtained tmz luggage stolen allegedly contained fake breast news obtained report listed missing content including breast prothesis however tridevil claim underwent surgery month ago cost internet rumour site snopes also uncovered jasminetridevil com site registered alisha hessler someone tridevil bares striking resemblance however news reporter charles bill tracked tridevil insisted surgery third breast real deal figured people would sceptical true recorded surgery show said tridevil insisted surgery went ahead tried doctor found one willing perform surgery surgeon also dismissed possibility real new york plastic surgeon matthew schulman told daily dot believe per cent hoax everyone falling said would happy go record claiming falsified story essentially possible michigan surgeon dr anthony youn agreed surgery possible highly unlikely anyone would perform youtube clip tridevil said extra breast felt like two difference nipple get tattooed year old saved two year could surgery also paying film crew follow around also said surgery documented film crew prove story true mirror reported tridevil received plenty venom social medium hour ago posted pain temporary glory forever facebook page hour earlier wrote afraid different make beautiful also posted photo pre surgery host compliment question would want change omg done know happening seriously going viral right first time m hessler made headline last year chose publicly humiliate man beat instead sending prison said introduced man friend invited clubbing last december beat unwanted sexual advance received hospital treatment police report filed instead pressing charge offered attacker ultimatum telling either press charge arrested year sit outside busy intersection hour holding sign say beat woman,world revealed paid thousand dollar get third breast surgically attached chest florida woman jasmine tridevil facing claim surgery fake made claim come american news channel news revealed tridevil go real name alisha jasmine hessler filed incident report losing three breast prosthesis earlier month tridevil filed report bag stolen tampa international airport september report also obtained tmz luggage stolen allegedly contained fake breast news . tridevil insisted surgery went ahead tried doctor found one willing perform surgery surgeon also dismissed possibility
2393,"Apple and LG seem to have a trusty, healthy relationship on display. Not only has the Korean technological giant outfitted Apple's premium iPad tablets with their high-resolution displays, but the latest word on the subject is that the relationship will continue for the Apple Watch as well! JP Morgan analyst JJ Park claims that LG is the sole supplier of the wearable's flexible Plastic OLED screen.

LG has been on the forefront of this technology, going as far as to produce flexible lighting panels made entirely of plastic. So Apple's demands shouldn't be a problem for LG's display arm, although it has quite a bit of work cut out for it with Cupertino gearing up to ship 26 to 29 million watches this year, and another 61 million next. This will generate billions of dollars (and trillions of Korean wons) of revenue for LG, but other analysts think Apple will ship just 8.5 million watches, so let's not juggle the big numbers already.

2394,"Kim Jong-un has not been photographed in public since September 3

He has been seen walking with a limp, raising speculation it may be gout

31-year-old imports vast quantities of Emmental - his favourite variety

His weight has ballooned in recent months and he now walks with a limp

But experts think weight gain may be deliberate to look like late grandfather

After more than a week of speculation, North Korea has finally admitted its 'Dear Leader' is poorly - sparking new rumours he may have gout.

Kim Jong-un, whose weight has ballooned in recent months thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese, has been struck down by a mystery illness, his henchmen in Pyongyang revealed today, saying only that he was 'suffering from discomfort'.

It comes after the 31-year-old vanished from his usual role as centrepiece to the isolated country's propaganda machine after last appearing in public at a concert with his wife on September 3, fuelling speculation he is suffering from bad health.

He had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media on Thursday appeared to have difficulty walking.

Unwell? Kim, 31, who is frequently the centrepiece of the isolated country's propaganda, has not been photographed by state media since September 3, fuelling speculation he is unwell. He has also been seen walking with a limp

'The wealth and prosperity of our socialism is thanks to the painstaking efforts of our marshal, who keeps lighting the path for the people, like the flicker of a flame, despite suffering discomfort,' a voice over for the hour-long documentary said.

The documentary was followed by a pre-recorded broadcast of a North Korean Supreme People's Assembly meeting from which Kim Jong Un was notably absent.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show.

North Korea observers speculate Kim's weight and family background may have contributed to his condition.

'Disease of Kings': Historically known as 'the disease of kings', with Henry VIII a known sufferer, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle

'Based on his gait, it appears he has gout - something (due to) diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,' said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Historically known as 'the disease of kings', with Henry VIII a known sufferer, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle.

The condition used to be rare among young people, but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people.

Men are more likely to develop gout than women because their uric acid levels rise during puberty and remain higher than women through adulthood.

It usually first appears between the ages of 30 to 60 and becomes more common with age.

The condition is characterised by sudden onset of acute pain, redness and swelling in the joints such as the big toe.

Gout is caused by a build-up of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a waste product that forms when the body breaks down chemicals in the cells known as purines.

If you produce too much uric acid or excrete too little when you urinate, the uric acid will build up and may cause needle-like crystals in and around the joints, most commonly in the foot (particularly the big toe), but also the knees, fingers, forearms and elbows.

The crystals may spill over from the joint cartilage into the joint space, causing a painful attack.

Foods naturally high in purines include red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork - seafood, especially shellfish and oily fish, and offal.

'It is protein-rich foods that cause gout,' dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline. 'Cheese is not a high risk food, although eating a lot of it will mean he is likely to have high calcium – and cholesterol – levels.'

Other risk factors include obesity - partly because of extra pressure on the joints and chemical changes as a result of the fat - and heavy alcohol consumption, particularly beer, which is high in purines, and spirits.

Smoking is not generally seen as a risk factor for gout.

The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp.

Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic.

Kim has not been a presence in state media since attending a Pyongyang concert on September 3.

There's been no discussion of the absence in the authoritarian North's media.

North Korea's official Korean Central Television says the Supreme People's Assembly approved the promotion of Hwang Pyong So as the vice chairman of the country's powerful National Defense Commission.

Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat.

Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror.

North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung.

He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s.

Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Saenuri Party, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.

2395,"Jim Suva with Citigroup this evening weighs in with what to expect from the March 9th media event in San Francisco that Apple (AAPL) announced today, an event that is likely focused on Apple Watch, given that, as he points out, Daylight Savings Time starts the day before, March 8th, so the tag line of the event, “Spring Forward,” is an apt time reference.

Suva, who has a Buy rating on Apple, and a $135 price target, lays out the prospects for details about the watch, including pricing:

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months. A flurry of fashionable accessories including various colors and materials (plastic, leather, and metal, including high-end metals such as gold, silver and platinum), starting at $29 and ranging over several hundred dollars. We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use). Purchase locations to be Apple retail stores and Apple online store only. Hundreds of applications immediately available upon release, ranging from social, financial, health, sports and news etc.

Apple is more likely to benefit from continued iPhone 6 sales, Suva opines. Still, the WTch is among things that expand its addressable market:

We do note Apple is actively expanding its total available market (watches, payments, automotive etc). We expect Apple to sell 3.1M watch units in the June qtr, with a F12M est of 17.1M watch units.

2396,"The Apple Watch will go on sale in March, and though component shortages may be an issue, about 5 million of the devices are likely to be sold in the first quarter, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo.

Apple hasn’t given a launch date for its first smartwatch, which it unveiled in September, only saying to expect the device in early 2015. In addition to Kuo’s research note, however, other reports also have said the watch will be generally available in March.

Before the device becomes available, Apple will reveal additional information on the watch, including battery specifics and pre-order details, said Kuo, according to a story on the website MacRumors. Apple has said the smartwatch will need nightly recharging, but hasn’t offered other battery information.

Component issues may cause supply problems for the watch, Kuo said. Even with possible component shortages, Apple will sell 2.8 million Apple Watches in March and go on to sell 5 million devices in the first quarter of 2015, he said. Kuo called for iPhone shipments for that quarter to exceed 61 million units and iPad shipments to come in at 10 million units.

2402,"Claim: A ghost ship filled with Ebola-ridden rats is heading towards Florida.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, January 2015]

Would like to confirm latest fantastical story making the rounds on Facebook: Ghost ship filled with Ebola-ridden rats heading for Florida.

Origins: On 7 January 2015, the entertainment web site World News Daily Report published an article claiming a ghost ship filled with Ebola-infected rats was heading towards Florida:

A large cargo ship originating from West Africa has the American authorities on high alert as it is approaching the coast of Florida. All 17 crew members of the Guinean Luck are reported to have died from the ebola hemorrhagic fever and the presence of thousands of rats possibly infected with the disease aboard the ship could represent a major threat for the American population.

The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

""We are determined to protect the American population from this unique threat"" says coast guard commander, James Fitzgerald. ""There is no way we are going to let those disease-ridden rats set foot in the USA. We're gonna find that ship and we're gonna sink it!""

The fictitious World News Daily Report article contained fabricated photos, made-up mathematical measurements, and imaginary quotes from invented officials. These dubious details gave the story an air of authenticity, and many readers took to social media to spread news of the ghost ship's impending arrival.

But there is no truth to the above-quoted story. World News Daily Report is a fake news site, and its disclaimer notes all articles published on the web site are for entertainment purposes only:

2416,"A stray cat from Canada, who was born with both male and female genitalia, is set to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Mittens has to have the surgery to correct bowel and urinary tract issues.

“I’d like for it to be a female, but it really doesn’t matter,” owner Colleen Clarke-Murphy told Canada’s CBC News. “I think it’s got both personalities, so it really don’t matter.”

The Newfoundland resident says her daughter found Mittens as a stray and brought her home. But one trip to the veterinarian in October was all it took for Murphy to discover that there was more to her kitty than met the eye.

Murphy was shocked to find out that her new kitty was in fact a hermaphrodite. The vet explained that Mittens would have to have the surgery to allow the confused cat to go to the bathroom without any problems.

Murphy didn’t think twice about coughing up the cash to give her feline the procedure it needed.

“She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter,” she told CBC.

The vet says Mittens will be both spayed and neutered before the reconstructive surgery takes place.",stray cat canada born male female genitalia set undergo gender reassignment surgery mitten surgery correct bowel urinary tract issue like female really matter owner colleen clarke murphy told canada cbc news think got personality really matter newfoundland resident say daughter found mitten stray brought home one trip veterinarian october took murphy discover kitty met eye murphy shocked find new kitty fact hermaphrodite vet explained mitten would surgery allow confused cat go bathroom without problem murphy think twice coughing cash give feline procedure needed part family came home daughter told cbc vet say mitten spayed neutered reconstructive surgery take place,cat canada born male female genitalia set undergo gender reassignment surgery mitten surgery correct bowel urinary tract issue like female really matter owner colleen clarke murphy told canada cbc news think got personality really matter newfoundland resident say daughter found mitten stray brought home one trip veterinarian october took murphy discover kitty met eye murphy shocked find new kitty fact hermaphrodite vet explained mitten would surgery allow confused cat go bathroom without problem mur

According to a report citing supply chain sources by Taiwanese website UDN, Apple will use a two-lens system in the camera of the next-generation iPhone. The dual lens setup will help the iPhone capture more light, resulting in better photos. It will also add optical zoom capability to the camera, which also gives better photos compared to cameras with digital zoom.

The report also says that Apple will use its Force Touch technology in the upcoming iPhones. This technology, already being used in Apple Watch, will allow the touchscreen distinguish between light taps and long presses, thus allowing the users to interact with their iPhones in several new ways.

2425,"Jasmine Tridevil, 21, spent $20,000 for the plastic surgery, she told an Orlando radio station. 'To me it just feels like another boob,' she says. 'The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.'

One of these things is not like the others.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unatttractive to men.""

The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore.

""Well I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show last week. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

The Afghan soldiers went missing Saturday at Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady said the three men were reported missing on Saturday night after traveling into Hyannis that day.

""They didn't report back (to the base),"" Sahady said. ""There is no indication they pose a threat to the public.""

The three men were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

There are 200 soldiers and civilians participating in the seven-day event at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. Along with 12 other members of the Afghanistan National Army, the three men were all engaged in the joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies that involved civilians and officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said.

There were six nations, including the U.S., participating in the exercise, which is ongoing and is scheduled to wrap up by Wednesday.

2427,"According to a report late Tuesday, Apple is on the verge of announcing an acquisition of social network and corresponding app Path, possibly in a bid to restart a branded platform after the failure of Ping.

As reported by Pando Daily, a source with knowledge of the matter claims an agreement between Apple and Path is ""essentially a done deal."" The publication cites one person currently working for Apple in unnamed engineering department.

Interestingly, the source says Apple is looking to keep Path intact following the rumored buyout, a tactic that strays from the company's usual M&A tactics. Save for the recent acquisition of Beats, Apple usually performs so-called ""acquihires,"" or purchases made for talent, not a brand name. The publication speculates that Path may make its way into iOS Messages.

Pando Daily also points out that Path cofounder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row at Flint Center for Tuesday's iPhone 6 keynote. Apple saves those seats for high-ranking executives and special guests. For example, during the presentation, Jony Ive was seen sitting with design superstar and new Apple employee Marc Newson.

Pricing went unmentioned, but the struggling social networking firm's recent round of funding reportedly clocked in at a sub-$400 million valuation, much less than a rumored $500 million valuation sought by executives. Further, Path is not a high-ranking title in the iOS App Store and currently sits below the top-1,000 downloaded apps.

Aside from being one of the less popular social networking services, Path had a few missteps that drew scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies and even Apple itself. In 2012, the firm was dinged for uploading users' address books without permission, claiming the automated action was meant to more easily find other friends using the app. The issue snowballed into a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation, which was ultimately settled for $800,000 in early 2013.

On the day Path's settlement, a researcher discover a flaw in the app's backend that geotagged photos uploaded by users. The problem was quickly patched, but shortly thereafter Path was again accused of unacceptable contacts handling techniques.

Despite its troubles, Path has been featured in the iOS App Store and most recently broke off its in-app messaging feature as a standalone app called Path Talk.",according report late tuesday apple verge announcing acquisition social network corresponding app path possibly bid restart branded platform failure ping reported pando daily source knowledge matter claim agreement apple path essentially done deal publication cite one person currently working apple unnamed engineering department interestingly source say apple looking keep path intact following rumored buyout tactic stray company usual tactic save recent acquisition beat apple usually performs called acquihires purchase made talent brand name publication speculates path may make way io message pando daily also point path cofounder dave morin seen sitting front row flint center tuesday iphone keynote apple save seat high ranking executive special guest example presentation jony ive seen sitting design superstar new apple employee marc newson pricing went unmentioned struggling social networking firm recent round funding reportedly clocked sub million valuation much le rumored million valuation sought executive path high ranking title io app store currently sits top downloaded apps aside one le popular social networking service path misstep drew scrutiny governmental regulatory agency even apple firm dinged uploading user address book without permission claiming automated action meant easily find friend using app issue snowballed u federal trade commission investigation ultimately settled early day path settlement researcher discover flaw app backend geotagged photo uploaded user problem quickly patched shortly thereafter path accused unacceptable contact handling technique despite trouble path featured io app store recently broke app messaging feature standalone app called path talk,tuesday apple verge announcing acquisition social network corresponding app path possibly bid restart branded platform failure ping reported pando daily source knowledge matter claim agreement apple path essentially done deal publication cite one person currently working apple unnamed engineering department interestingly source say apple looking keep path intact following rumored buyout tactic stray company usual tactic save recent acquisition beat apple usually performs called acquihires purchase made talent brand name publication speculates path may make way i

But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.

A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?

With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.

At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.

And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.

It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.

And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.

Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:

“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.

“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”

Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.

And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.

But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.

And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.

Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.

There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.

And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.

Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.",long ago nhl commissioner gary bettman treating talk expansion though asked like epidemic ebola recently nature rhetoric changed much question becoming ultimate question able limit number new team two source close situation indicated la vega done deal thing determined owner entitled proclaim brought first major league sport franchise sin city given dead set team gambling commissioner year ago move another player friendly state tax free zone represents considerable face indeed people betting hockey game year pretend game fixed easily anywhere vega pretty ridiculous posturing fallen wayside new team close newly renamed arizona squad california big three assured question city plural activity going seattle area last little bit would quite stretch imagine much time effort spent many wealthy men frittered away nothing moment surefire plan build new rink could change time vancouver billionaire victor coleman among many reportedly showing interest putting nhl team city bettman visiting see really rain lot year since nhl expanded given team east west taking two team would certainly seem make lot sense amount sense made realignment first announced expanding without player getting mitt money increase payroll surely tempting least owner remember hefty cheque cashed columbus minnesota whereas commissioner balked expansion sample recent verbal footwork lot interest hearing multiple group seattle vega kansa city quebec city bettman said tribune scoping target field minny yet another trip well outdoor game decided engage formal expansion process listen expression interest something seriously considered yet like hell nut thinking seriously since thing changed commissioner hate move team league matter dire circumstance might appear one likable aspect regime hockey fan league come area going stay thick thin almost impossible seems case phoenix could long standing policy loyalty change florida situation true lease panther bleeding money even city sunrise seem see point carrying much longer perhaps one new city could get existing team kansa city really likely serious contender expansion soup unless going stretch four team saying quebec city favour two u city proven nhl background almost certainly going happen going back minnesota success question money corporate backing ever quebec even expansion team new arena would virtually assured sellout perpetuity manner bleating insufficient talent course even true long wait trivial detail trouble fan going get way financial windfall like time league decides could use talent start away coach employ whose chief calling life devise way stop offensive player choke life game paying salary expansion happening soon question many new city involved,nhl commissioner gary bettman treating talk expansion though asked like epidemic ebola recently nature rhetoric changed much question becoming ultimate question able limit number new team two source close situation indicated la vega done deal thing determined owner entitled proclaim brought first major league sport franchise sin city given dead set team gambling commissioner year ago move another player friendly state tax free zone represents considerable face indeed people betting hockey game year pretend game fixed easily anywhere vega done deal thing determined owner entitled proclaim brought first major league sport franchise sin city given dead
2429,"BUTTE, Montana -

Robert O’Neill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. O’Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.

Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.

“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.

O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.

“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.

The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police.

2430,"Iraqi forces reach centre of northern city of Baiji in attempt to break the Isis siege of the country’s biggest refinery

Authorities in Iraq were tonight investigating claims that the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been “critically injured” in US-led air strikes, prompting speculation of his death.

The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group. Britain’s chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, warned, however, that the Isis leadership would regenerate even if Baghdadi had been killed.

General Houghton told the BBC: “I can’t absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has died. Even the Americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.”

Friday’s strikes destroyed an Isis convoy near the Iraqi city of Mosul, but US officials said it was unclear whether the group’s top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles. Tribal sources told the Saudi news channel Al Arabiya that after the strike Isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al-Qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured.

Meanwhile, Iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji on Sunday, trying to break the Isis siege of the country’s biggest refinery, outside the city. This led to fierce fighting. Sunni insurgents had seized Baiji in June, during a lightning advance through northern Iraq. Since then, they surrounded the refinery and halted its production, while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege.

An Iraqi colonel said troops had entered Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre. Isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the government forces from advancing – tactics used in other cities held by the ultra-hardline Sunni group, which controls swathes of both Iraq and Syria.",iraqi force reach centre northern city baiji attempt break isi siege country biggest refinery authority iraq tonight investigating claim isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi critically injured u led air strike prompting speculation death death elusive leader would mark significant change u led effort curtail islamist extremist group britain chief defence staff general sir nicholas houghton warned however isi leadership would regenerate even baghdadi killed general houghton told bbc absolutely confirm baghdadi died even american yet position probably take day absolute confirmation friday strike destroyed isi convoy near iraqi city mosul u official said unclear whether group top commander targeted vehicle tribal source told saudi news channel al arabiya strike isi member scrambled transport wounded al qaim hospital overwhelmed injured meanwhile iraqi military force reached centre northern city baiji sunday trying break isi siege country biggest refinery outside city led fierce fighting sunni insurgent seized baiji june lightning advance northern iraq since surrounded refinery halted production detachment government troop inside held month siege iraqi colonel said troop entered baiji city people south west took al tamim neighbourhood city centre isi placed bomb along road deployed sniper keep government force advancing tactic used city held ultra hardline sunni group control swathe iraq syria,iraqi force reach centre northern city baiji attempt break isi siege country biggest refinery authority iraq tonight investigating claim isi leader abu bakr al baghdadi critically injured u led air strike prompting speculation death death elusive leader would mark significant change u led effort curtail islamist extremist group britain chief defence staff general sir nicholas houghton warned however isi leadership would regenerate even baghdadi killed general
2435,"It's a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia's religious police, isn't a fan of Cole Porter. ""The lure of you"" is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women's eyes that are deemed ""tempting."" ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones"" he said. ""[We] have the right to do so.""
What are ""tempting"" eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are ""uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble."" The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means ""having an appeal."" What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is ""arousing a sympathetic response."" And what is sympathetic? ""Showing empathy,"" according to Merriam-Webster.

So there you have it. To allow a women's eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police--massively funded by King Abdullah--cannot do this. ""It's so stupid,"" the Saudi journalist tells me. ""I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

Perhaps they won't be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: ""The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee."" No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.

How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.

If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it ""tempting"" to stop treating women as property.",safe bet sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman saudi arabia religious police fan cole porter lure precisely nabet announced yesterday committee promotion virtue prevention vice cover woman eye deemed tempting men committee interfere force woman cover eye especially tempting one said right tempting eye one saudi journalist mused condition anonymity uncovered eye nice shape makeup even without makeup beautiful woman trouble orwellian named committee provide definition tempting happen rely merriam webster mean appeal appeal according dictionary arousing sympathetic response sympathetic showing empathy according merriam webster allow woman eye capture unfettered glory world one must empathize existence religious police massively funded king abdullah stupid saudi journalist tell know say stop many people oppose country silent perhaps committee promotion virtue prevention vice powerful backer country prince naif recently appointed heir throne said committee supported side supported pillar islam muslim support committee surprise king abdullah awarded draconian body additional million riyal million march america respond latest affront saudi woman perhaps sponsor contest tempting eye saudi arabia woman send picture tempting look winner get accompany president obama next meeting saudi dictator congress reconsidered recent billion u saudi arm deal religious police might quickly find tempting stop treating woman property,sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman saudi arabia religious police fan cole porter lure precisely nabet announced yesterday committee promotion virtue prevention vice cover woman eye deemed tempting men committee interfere force woman cover eye especially tempting one said right tempting eye one saudi journalist mused condition anonymity uncovered eye nice shape makeup even without makeup beautiful woman trouble orwellian named committee provide definition tempting happen rely merriam webster mean appeal appeal according dictionary arousing sympathetic response sympathetic showing

2439,"The 81-year-old comedienne was supposed to only have a routine procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28, but it took an ultimately fatal turn. Her personal doctor paused to snap a self-portrait while she was under anesthesia, CNN reported.

Joan Rivers’ personal doctor stopped to take a selfie in the procedure room while the famous comedienne was under anesthesia, just moments before she went into cardiac arrest, CNN reported Tuesday.

Rivers, 81, was getting a routine scoping of her throat at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28 when her own physician performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords, a source told the Daily News.

The procedure sent the famed funny woman into a death spiral.

A staff member at the Upper East Side clinic told CNN that the personal physician — who was not authorized to practice medicine at the private facility — paused to snap a self-portrait.

Rivers was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen.

Cohen has since been let go by the clinic. Rivers’ personal physician has not yet been named.

2449,"On Sunday, the blogosphere went into overdrive when a Tweet attributed to Lisa Bonet seemed aimed at Bill Cosby.

""According to the karma of past actions, one's destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky,"" read the Tweet, which was posted on an account using Bonet's name. ""Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!""

Was Bonet – who played Cosby's daughter, Denise, on The Cosby Show from 1989 to 1992 – addressing the numerous sexual assault allegations against the 77-year-old comedian? (The actor has denied the claims through his lawyer.)

The answer: No, she was not.




""Lisa Bonet has no social media of any kind,"" her manager tells PEOPLE exclusively.

""Any posts made in her name were made by impersonators with unverified accounts. She also has no comment on the ongoing story.""

The fake Twitter account has since been suspended.

Bonet isn't the first of Cosby's Huxtable family to speak out. Raven-Symoné (who played Cosby's step-granddaughter, Olivia, on the show) took to social media last week to deny rumors that she was one of his victims.

""I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show!"" she posted on her Instagram.

2461,"Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.

Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.

Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number. As for Cupertino's original vision, well, there's always a chance that we'll see it come to life in the coming years. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G.

2462,"Egyptian President General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has offered Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas the chance to create a Palestinian state in the Sinai Peninsula, according to local Israeli media.

The offer to the Palestinian President which, reports say Abbas has denied, would have seen 1,600 square kilometres of the Sinai Peninsula given to the Palestinian Authority, creating a Palestinian state five times the size of Gaza.

According to IDF Radio, the offer would see Abbas relinquish demands that Israel return to the 1967 borders.

In the new and enlarged Gaza, the territory would be demilitarised and Palestinian refugees, many who were unable to return to their towns after the creation of Israel, would have been able to settle there.

As part of the proposal, Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank would have been autonomous and continued to be under Palestinian Authority control.

Sisi allegedly said to Abbas in the meeting: ""You are now 80 years old, if you don't accept this proposal, your successor will.""

The Palestinian Authority is yet to publicly comment on the initiative but unnamed sources said that Abbas rejected the deal in a meeting with Sisi.

The Israeli military radio station said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had knowledge of the offer and that the United States had given its approval to such an idea.

An idea along the same lines was introduced years ago by Israeli academics but Egypt rejected the proposal.

Elsewhere, the future of a unity government between Abbas' Fatah and Hamas remains uncertain after the Palestinian president voiced his displeasure at the Islamist group's ""shadow"" leadership of Gaza.

""We cannot continue working with Hamas this way. There are 27 undersecretaries of ministries who are running the Gaza Strip, and the national unity government cannot do anything on the ground.

2464,"The cameras on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may be some of the best on the smartphone market, but they could be trumped by the camera on the next iteration of the iPhone. Though the next phone -- possibly the ""iPhone 6s"" -- isn't expected for another eight months, sources within Apple Inc.’s supply chain in Asia have detailed a “dual-lens” camera module, according to Chinese publication UDN. Such a feature would improve the camera’s low-light performance and could also aid in optical image stabilization.

Apple has long used a single lens with a five-element design on its cameras. Minor camera upgrades on each new generation of iPhone have kept consumers satisfied. But in 2014, the manufacturer introduced a bigger update: optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus in particular is said to be on par with the image quality of point-and-shoot cameras. The iPhone 6 did not get that feature.

Now, Apple may provide the next iPhone with its largest camera upgrade in Apple’s history. Information out of Apple’s Asia supply chain has often been reliable in the past, and tallies with prior reports suggesting that Apple will put a camera in the new iPhone that will rival the image quality of DSLR cameras. Daring Fireball's John Gruber said in November that Apple is working on a “weird two-lens system” for a future iPhone.

Devices like the HTC One M8 include a dual-lens camera, created by the Israeli startup Corephotonics. But Apple usually uses lenses by Sony.

The ""iPhone 6s"" may also implement a feature called Force Touch, according to the Taipei-based touch module supplier TPK. Force Touch lets the Apple Watch interpret different levels of pressure for different actions; a user can press heavily on the smartwatch screen to open an options menu, and then use a light tough to select an option. The Apple Watch is expected to launch sometime in March.",camera iphone iphone plus may best smartphone market could trumped camera next iteration iphone though next phone possibly iphone expected another eight month source within apple inc supply chain asia detailed dual lens camera module according chinese publication udn feature would improve camera low light performance could also aid optical image stabilization apple long used single lens five element design camera minor camera upgrade new generation iphone kept consumer satisfied manufacturer introduced bigger update optical image stabilization phase detection autofocus iphone plus camera iphone plus particular said par image quality point shoot camera iphone get feature apple may provide next iphone largest camera upgrade apple history information apple asia supply chain often reliable past tally prior report suggesting apple put camera new iphone rival image quality dslr camera daring fireball john gruber said november apple working weird two lens system future iphone device like htc one include dual lens camera created israeli startup corephotonics apple usually us lens sony iphone may also implement feature called force touch according taipei based touch module supplier tpk force touch let apple watch interpret different level pressure different action user press heavily smartwatch screen open option menu use light tough select option apple watch expected launch sometime march,iphone iphone plus may best smartphone market could trumped camera next iteration iphone though next phone possibly iphone expected another eight month source within apple inc supply chain asia detailed dual lens camera module according chinese publication udn feature would improve camera low light performance could also aid optical image stabilization apple long used single lens five element design camera minor camera upgrade new generation iphone kept consumer satisfied manufacturer introduced bigger update optical image stabilization phase detection autofocus iphone plus camera iphone plus particular said par image quality point shoot camera iphone get feature apple may

2482,"19-year-old Iga Jasica of Poland began making headlines recently after the rumor got out that she accidentally awoke during brain surgery to enjoy a friendly conversation with the surgical staff about cats. Though only part of the story is true, we’re sort of thrilled to be able to report that it’s the part about the mid-brain surgery conversation about cats. Iga revealed on her Facebook page Saturday that her temporary consciousness during the procedure was actually all part of the plan.

The teen told well wishers that when it came to the publications sharing her story, many “articles have a lot of mistakes.” She explains that far from being a shock to her doctors, “waking me up was deliberate – This method is called Awake Craniatomy. It was deliberate and planned.”

Jasica even provided readers with a link to the website of University Hospital Southampton where the surgery is described in detail. “An awake craniotomy is an operation performed in the same manner as a conventional craniotomy but with the patient awake during the procedure. This is a preferred technique for operations to remove lesions close to, or involving, eloquent (functionally important) regions of the brain. This allows us to test regions of the brain before they are incised or removed and allows us to test patient’s function continuously throughout the operation. The overall aim is to minimise the risks of such operations,” it says.

Despite the fact that her brain was indeed exposed during the waking parts of her surgery, neurosurgeon Dawid Larysz recently assured The Daily Mirror that Jasica would not have been able to see or hear anything. “Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” he said.

Jasica herself later commented, “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had, as I am now feeling great.”

She stresses on her Facebook page that the “operation was successful and there was nothing damaged.” The teen says it’s important to her that people know that the “Doctors saved my life” and encourages readers to “not be influenced by stupid articles.”

Otherwise the 19-year-old seems to be progressing well in her recovery and is looking forward to healthier days.

2484,"TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry (BB.TO: Quote) (BBRY.O: Quote) shares rose more than 3 percent on Monday after a news website said Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (0922.HK: Quote) might offer to buy the Canadian technology company.

Benzinga.com, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, said an offer worth $15 a share could come as early as this week.

Lenovo and BlackBerry said their companies did not comment on rumors and speculation.

Rumors of a Lenovo bid for BlackBerry have swirled many times over the last two years. Senior Lenovo executives at different times have indicated an interest in BlackBerry as a means to strengthen their own handset business.

The speculation reached a crescendo in the fall of 2013, when BlackBerry was exploring strategic alternatives.

Sources familiar with the situation however, told Reuters last year that the Canadian government had strongly hinted to BlackBerry that any sale to Lenovo would not win the necessary regulatory approvals due to security concerns.

BlackBerry's secure networks manage the email traffic of thousands of large corporate customers, along with government and military agencies across the globe. Under Canadian law, any foreign takeover of BlackBerry would require government approval under the Industry Canada Act.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Reuters in February 2012 that he wanted BlackBerry to grow ""as a Canadian company."" And in December 2011, then-Industry Minister Christian Paradis referred to the company as a ""Canadian jewel.""

Analysts also have said any sale to Lenovo would face regulatory obstacles, but they have suggested that a sale of just BlackBerry's handset business and not its core network infrastructure might just pass muster with regulators.

BlackBerry's long-struggling handset business turned a profit before special items in the last quarter, after the Waterloo, Ontario-based company concluded its three-year restructuring program.

However, BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen has said he sees the handset business as core to the company for now, as it will foster sales growth over the next few quarters until the software and services business begins to generate new revenue streams in the first half of 2015.

Shares of BlackBerry were up 3.4 percent at $9.81 in early Nasdaq trading. Its Toronto-listed shares were up 3.1 percent at C$11.03.

2486,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

2488,"Apple has opted to delay production on the rumored larger-screened ""iPad Pro"" due to issues with display panel supply, reports Bloomberg. Manufacturing on the tablet will reportedly begin in September, rather than earlier in the year.Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren't public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar those plans had said.This isn't the first time that rumors have hinted at delays for the iPad Pro. Apple was said to be targeting an early 2015 release date for the tablet last year, but those plans were reportedly put on hold. Back in October, The Wall Street Journal said that Apple had opted to delay mass production on the iPad in order to focus on iPhone 6 Plus production, and in November, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said production could be delayed until Q2 2015 because of difficulties related to the production of display components. With production delayed until September, the tablet could see a release in late 2015.

Rendering of the iPad Pro by Martin Hajek
Apple is planning to use the ""iPad Pro,"" as the media calls it, to boost its flagging iPad sales. The tablet is expected to measure in somewhere between 12.2 and 12.9 inches, dwarfing both the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 and the 7.9-inch iPad mini 3.

It may be targeted at the enterprise market, and rumors have suggested it could sport an ""ultra"" high-resolution display and stereo speakers at the top and bottom edges of the device for an improved audio experience. It may also ship with an optional stylus accessory.

2491,"n a most horrific form of child abuse, young children in a school in Ekurh, Johannesburg, South Africa, were caught imitating the cruel sport of dog fighting, while other students placed bets on who the winner would be, reports iolnews.com.

Inspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to intervene, when a school principal noticed a pattern of children as young as eight-years-old returning from recess, injured and with their clothes torn.

Willson stated the children had been taught the disgusting action after adults, on weekends, would encourage them to watch dog fights and role play fights of their own with other children. The youngsters would get down on all fours and scratch, bite, bark and kick each other. The winner of the match would then get to ""mate"" with a child as a reward. It was unknown if the children actually had sexual intercourse. That was done in imitation of the winning dogs mating with the female dogs.

Willson stated while watching one video, if she closed her eyes and listened to the children fighting, the growls, barks, etc. sounded exactly like dogs in a canine dog fight.

As the children get older, Willson stated they become involved in the thefts of dogs, their training and in fights. One child was recorded as saying:

“It makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful.""

During her investigation, Willson could find no other examples of such egregious horror except in the Gauteng Department of Education school district.

Teddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar, a non profit dedicated to helping abused children, also stated it was first time she had ever come in contact with children role playing dog-fighting, but addressed it as an extremely disturbing act:

""These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I’m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialized into that behavior. Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.”

2493,"A Russian man was recently able to fend off a bear attack with a Justin Bieber song.

Forty-two year old Igor Vorozhbitsyn was recently fishing in Russia's Yakutia Republic when he was attacked by a bear.

During the ordeal Vorozhbitsyn's phone -- which has Bieber's ""Baby"" as the ringtone -- went off, causing the startled bear to run away.

2499,"The highly anticipated Apple Watch, which has had a mysterious official launch date, is finally going to be released in April.

Tim Cook revealed the timing of the release of the Apple Watch during a conference call with analysts, clarifying the exact month of the device's launch, which Apple previously said would be in ""early 2015.""

""Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule,"" said Cook. ""We're going to be thrilled to start shipping it because we have a lot of customers wanting to get one,"" he said, referring to the company's first new product since the iPad.

Apple is entering the smartwatch industry a little late, as it did with the iPhone and the iPad in the smartphone and tablet computer industries, but it is looking to define the segment with the Apple Watch. Rival companies have launched smartwatches over the past several months, but the devices have not taken off in the market.

The Apple Watch was unveiled in September last year, with the company revealing that the price of the device would begin at $349. While the basic functions of the device are now known, there are still many questions surrounding the device, such as the cost of high-end models and whether the Apple Watch would have a ""killer app"" that could drastically boost the device's sales.

Apple news website 9to5 Mac acquired information regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the more expensive model that will include gold. The website claims that Apple's official stores will be outfitted with safes such as in jewelry stores to house the devices.


The safes, which will likely be utilized to hold inventory for sale as well as to safeguard demo units, will include the MagSafe chargers for the Apple Watch to keep the held units fully charged.

The news website also claims that Apple has already started the installation of the safes in certain stores ahead of the device's launch date.

Previous reports said that the price of the gold-plated Apple Watch Edition could reach thousands of dollars.

Ben Reitzes, an analyst for Barclays, believes that the launch of the smartwatch seems to be a bit delayed, but Cook's statement that April still qualifies as early 2015 is sufficient.

Cook said that he has been trying out the Apple Watch daily, adding that he ""can't live without it."" The Apple CEO also said that there is an ""impressive"" number of developers working on apps for the Apple Watch.",highly anticipated apple watch mysterious official launch date finally going released april tim cook revealed timing release apple watch conference call analyst clarifying exact month device launch apple previously said would early development apple watch right schedule said cook going thrilled start shipping lot customer wanting get one said referring company first new product since ipad apple entering smartwatch industry little late iphone ipad smartphone tablet computer industry looking define segment apple watch rival company launched smartwatches past several month device taken market apple watch unveiled september last year company revealing price device would begin basic function device known still many question surrounding device cost high end model whether apple watch would killer app could drastically boost device sale apple news website mac acquired information regarding apple watch edition expensive model include gold website claim apple official store outfitted safe jewelry store house device safe likely utilized hold inventory sale well safeguard demo unit include magsafe charger apple watch keep held unit fully charged news website also claim apple already started installation safe certain store ahead device launch date previous report said price gold plated apple watch edition could reach thousand dollar ben reitzes analyst barclays belief launch smartwatch seems bit delayed cook statement april still qualifies early sufficient cook said trying apple watch daily adding live without apple ceo also said impressive number developer working apps apple watch,apple watch mysterious official launch date finally going released april tim cook revealed timing release apple watch conference call analyst clarifying exact month device launch apple previously said would early development apple watch right schedule said cook going thrilled start shipping lot customer wanting get one said referring company first new product since ipad apple entering smartwatch industry little late iphone ipad smartphone tablet computer industry looking define segment apple watch rival company launched smartwatches past several month device taken market apple watch unveiled september last year company revealing price device would begin basic function
2500,"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN.

Dr. Gwen Korovin also ""categorically denies"" taking a selfie photo while Rivers was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the same source said Thursday.

The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN -- that staff members at the clinic told investigators Korovin snapped the selfie and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.

Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.

CNN's source close to the investigaton also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie.

Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers ""will think this is funny"" or ""would love this"" as she took the photo, the source said.

Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers.

Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning in the wake of Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore and hoarse throat, the source said.

Cohen detected something of concern, the source said..

Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cut off of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.

Rivers was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

Korovin was only authorized to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said.

Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated.

Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.

The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autograph photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews.

""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year.

Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the reports:

""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.""

The clinic is still open, although an accreditation group is calling for it to suspend procedures and surgeries, according to letters obtained by CNN. Patients were seen in the clinic's waiting room Wednesday.

The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group.

The letters cited two ""deficiencies"" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in ""immediate jeopardy"" and placed it on ""emergency suspension."" The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries ""until accreditation questions are settled.""

The clinic sent CNN a statement Wednesday night in response to questions about the accreditation association's letter putting the facility under ""emergency suspension.""

""Yorkville Endoscopy continues to maintain its federal, state and Quad A (AAAASF) authorization to be operational and provide patient care. Yorkville Endoscopy is committed to adhering to the standards established by Quad A (AAASF),"" the statement said.

While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of River's personal throat doctor.

Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.

2503,"She apparently hoped tourist attraction would make a lot of money

Serial killer Charles Manson's supposed budding romance with a woman 53 years his junior has been allegedly exposed as a money-making scheme.

According to journalist Daniel Simone, 27-year old Afton Elaine Burton, now known as Star, was hoping that she would gain possession of Manson's corpse through marriage so she and a couple of friends could put it on display in a glass case in LA.

They apparently thought the Lenin's Tomb-esque attraction would draw a huge number of visitors and make a lot of money.

But Manson, 80, apparently got wind of the plan and now no longer wants to marry Burton.

""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool,"" Simone told The NY Post.

The tourist attraction was also something of a non-starter because Manson believes he is immortal.

""He feels he will never die,"" Simone added. ""Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.""

Manson and Burton's marriage license expired on Thursday, though Burton apparently remains hopeful that it will be renewed.

Perhaps Manson had the last laugh though - Simone claims he never intended to marry and was stringing Burton and her friends along with the prospect of a wedding as they continued to bring him toiletries and other items.",apparently hoped tourist attraction would make lot money serial killer charles manson supposed budding romance woman year junior allegedly exposed money making scheme according journalist daniel simone year old afton elaine burton known star hoping would gain possession manson corpse marriage couple friend could put display glass case la apparently thought lenin tomb esque attraction would draw huge number visitor make lot money manson apparently got wind plan longer want marry burton finally realized played fool simone told ny post tourist attraction also something non starter manson belief immortal feel never die simone added therefore feel stupid idea begin manson burton marriage license expired thursday though burton apparently remains hopeful renewed perhaps manson last laugh though simone claim never intended marry stringing burton friend along prospect wedding continued bring toiletry item,hoped tourist attraction would make lot money serial killer charles manson supposed budding romance woman year junior allegedly exposed money making scheme according journalist daniel simone year old afton elaine burton known star hoping would gain possession manson corpse marriage couple friend could put display glass case la apparently thought lenin tomb esque attraction would draw huge number visitor make lot money manson apparently got wind plan longer want marry burton finally realized played fool simone told ny post

2507,"Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky.

Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll.

The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough.

What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations

The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.

In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.

Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients.

Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.

Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com.

But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina

The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David,

Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.

Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.

The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items.

Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink

Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes (courtesy Sweetgreen)

In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish

School lunch in Alba, Spain (left): white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas

In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie.

This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans.

And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples.

The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive.

A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.

In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries.

The Chinese company's efforts to buy out the struggling phone maker were blocked by the Canadian government last year, but the firm could table a new bid as soon as this week, according to Benzinga.

The report states that Lenovo is prepared to make an initial bid of $15 per share, rising to $18 per share once the deal has been completed.

Neither company has commented on the merger, but it was reported earlier this year that a similar deal was blocked by the Canadian authorities due to the BlackBerry infrastructure's ties to national security.

Lenovo's alleged renewed interest in BlackBerry comes after the firm's Passport smartphone proved a hit with investors, despite receiving mixed reviews.

2517,"A man who allegedly made a habit of stealing women’s underwear from washing lines has been on the receiving end of some ironic mob justice.

After Chan Chun Chee was caught red handed by the women whose underwear had gone missing, they forced him to wear one of the pilfered bras and made him walk around the block in a classic example of public shaming.

Residents of the block of flats in Singapore first became aware of the kinky thief when items of clothing being left out to dry started going missing, sometimes even from inside their apartments.

Local man Teo Goh, 56, said: ‘We realised he was targeting windows where he knew women lived and knew were open, so we decided to teach him a lesson and publicly humiliate him.’

They sprung a trap by getting one of the women in the block to leave some underwear in plain sight near an open window.

The group then waited for the thief to make his move, before pouncing on him.

After ‘frog marching’ the culprit around the block in his new outfit and forcing him to promise never to steal from them again, the vigilante group called the police to have him arrested.

A police spokesman said: ‘We don’t condone vigilante activity but in this case it seems to have turned out OK.’

Chee now faces three years jail for breaking and entry and theft (plus these embarrassing photos will probably haunt him forever).

2518,"Over the last few months, the U.S. has ratcheted up military efforts against the Islamic militant group ISIS in a big way. Whether engaging in airstrikes to push them out of key points of infrastructure like the Mosul Dam in Iraq, or targeting convoys to try to destabilize the terrorist organization, the fighting has been ongoing. And now, there are reports that the biggest target of all may have been struck: Iraqi defense minister Khaled al-Abadi has claimed that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was injured by American airstrikes Friday night, the first such reports of an actual brush between al-Baghdadi and U.S. forces.

Not much is known about the background of al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed Caliph of the new Islamic State — he’s believed to be in his early forties, and ascended to the top of ISIS back in 2010, but the vast majority of his personal biography is unclear. What’s transparently clear, however, is the authority he asserts worldwide — ISIS’ vision of a Caliphate, with al-Baghdadi sitting at the top, is one which all Muslims would be forced to recognize if the group had its way.

In short, they’ve cut a fantastically bloody course through Iraq and Syria, killing Muslims, Christians and non-believers alike. They’ve also notably released multiple videos of grisly hostage executions, including those of Americans Steven Sotloff and James Foley.


As always, caution is important. The U.S. hasn’t confirmed these reports just yet, as Colonel Pat Ryder of CENTCOM told Fox News on Sunday, saying ”We have no information to corroborate press reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.” On Saturday, Ryder did acknowledge that the airstrikes had gone down, however, hitting targets near Mosul.

I can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series of air strikes yesterday evening in Iraq against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul. We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present.

Hopefully the situation will become clearer in the coming days — reports of al-Baghdadi’s injury have been cited by multiple news outlets, including Israeli papers Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, British paper The Guardian, and Time, but until there’s official word on the matter, it’s best not to get too ahead of things. And it’s also important not to assume that al-Baghdadi being injured, or even being killed, means that ISIS will fall apart.

The feeling of futility that sometimes comes with large-scale military battles against far-flung terrorist organizations comes from the ability of these groups to restructure and destabilize themselves, even when a leader dies — as demonstrated by the example of al-Qaeda and leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, for example, who’s been in command long after the death of Osama bin Laden. Basically, whether al-Baghdadi is in charge or not, ISIS will likely remain a worrying and potent force in the region, and one which the U.S. won’t be done engaging with.

2522,"The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson – to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Although this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.

According to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into ‘El Lobison’, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.

The fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.

The tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.

Although having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.

The President has said that Yair is the first Jewish boy to take part in the ceremony, as the tradition was exclusive to Catholic children until 2009.",president argentina cristina fernandez de kirchner adopted jewish godson prevent becoming werewolf although sound like something straight fantasy novel president last week met yair tawil family unusual ceremony date back year based argentinian folklore according legend seventh son family transform el lobison werewolf like creature first friday boy th birthday continue turn blood thirsty baby eating werewolf every full moon fear creature fervent th century argentina many family murdered abandoned seventh born son forcing argentinian government implement process presidential adoption tradition established extended baby girl although seven child much rarer year ago seventh son daughter expect gain president official godparent well gold medal educational scholarship president said yair first jewish boy take part ceremony tradition exclusive catholic child,yair tawil family unusual ceremony date back year based argentinian folklore according legend seventh son family transform el lobison werewolf like creature first friday boy th birthday continue turn blood thirsty baby eating werewolf every full moon fear creature fervent th century argentina many family murdered abandoned seventh born son forcing argentinian government implement process presidential adoption tradition established extended baby girl although seven child much rarer year ago seventh son daughter expect gain president official godparent well gold
2527,"A female Kurdish fighter, who was viewed as an iconic face of the Kurdish resistance movement, has been reportedly beheaded by ISIS.

The woman, known by the nickname ‘Rehana’ became a face of the conflict after a picture of her holding a rifle and making a V sign was posted on Twitter, receiving over 5,000 retweets.

She fought for the Kurdish Women’s Defense Unit and claimed to have killed 100 ISIS militants.

It is now believed that Rehana may have been killed by IS militants after a picture circulated on Twitter, purporting to show her head being held aloft by a member of the jihadist organisation.

Her death has not been confirmed, however, by the Women’s Defense Unit.

She had been fighting to defend Kobane, a Syrian border town which has been under assault by ISIS for more than a month.

More than 10,000 women have helped to defend the town since the establishment of all female combat units in April.

They now reportedly play a major role in fighting against the IS.

Another female Kurdish fighter, who goes by the pseudonym of Afshin Kobani, said that the advancement of ISIS in Syria had forced to her to join the fight in Kobane.

‘I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,’

‘This is our land – our own – and if we don’t do it, who else will?

2533,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told France’s new president that he was “my guy” in the recent election, a French official said Thursday. The record shows only favorable words from Trump for centrist Emmanuel Macron’s opponent, the defeated far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

A look at Trump’s views, before and now, on this month’s French vote:

TRUMP to Macron at a lunch meeting in Brussels on Thursday, according to a French official: “You were my guy” in the French campaign. Trump also said he didn’t endorse Le Pen, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and requested anonymity.

THE FACTS: Trump may never have explicitly endorsed any candidate in France’s election, but he had only nice things to say about one candidate: Le Pen. Whatever views he may have expressed privately are unknown.

In an April 21 interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he believed an attack that week on police officers in Paris would help the National Front leader because the violence played to her strengths.

“She’s the strongest on borders, and she’s the strongest on what’s been going on in France,” Trump said in the Oval Office interview. “Whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism, and whoever is the toughest at the borders, will do well in the election.”

By contrast, Trump never spoke publicly about Macron before the vote. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Macron.

While Le Pen had echoed some of Trump’s hardline rhetoric on immigration, the U.S. leader’s words of support were surprising.

Le Pen had distanced herself from her father, National Front party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been convicted of crimes related to anti-Semitism and mocked the Holocaust as a “detail” of history. But she still drew criticism for denying during the campaign that the French state was responsible for the roundup of Jews during World War II, and maintained an inner circle of old friends from her student days that included members of a radical group known for violence and anti-Semitism.

Trump called Macron after his resounding victory. He also tweeted congratulations to the 39-year-old winner, saying he looked forward to working with him.",washington president donald trump told france new president guy recent election french official said thursday record show favorable word trump centrist emmanuel macron opponent defeated far right candidate marine le pen look trump view month french vote trump macron lunch meeting brussels thursday according french official guy french campaign trump also said endorse le pen according official authorized speak publicly matter requested anonymity fact trump may never explicitly endorsed candidate france election nice thing say one candidate le pen whatever view may expressed privately unknown april interview associated press trump said believed attack week police officer paris would help national front leader violence played strength strongest border strongest going france trump said oval office interview whoever toughest radical islamic terrorism whoever toughest border well election contrast trump never spoke publicly macron vote former president barack obama endorsed macron le pen echoed trump hardline rhetoric immigration u leader word support surprising le pen distanced father national front party founder jean marie le pen convicted crime related anti semitism mocked holocaust detail history still drew criticism denying campaign french state responsible roundup jew world war ii maintained inner circle old friend student day included member radical group known violence anti semitism trump called macron resounding victory also tweeted congratulation year old winner saying looked forward working,president donald trump told france new president guy recent election french official said thursday record show favorable word trump centrist emmanuel macron opponent defeated far right candidate marine le pen look trump view month french vote trump macron lunch meeting brussels thursday according french official guy french campaign trump also said endorse le pen according official authorized speak publicly matter requested anonymity fact trump may never explicitly endorsed candidate france election nice thing say one candidate
2534,"President Donald Trump congratulated newly-elected French president Emmanuel Macron, and in a brief photo-op at the US embassy in Brussels remarked on Macron’s “tremendous victory.”

“It is my great honor to be with the newly elected president of France, who ran an incredible campaign and had a tremendous victory,” Trump said. “All over the world they’re talking about it, and we have a lot to discuss, including terrorism and other things.”

“Congratulations, great job,” he added.

After an intense handshake, Trump also reportedly told Macron he was his preferred candidate in the face-off between the now-president and his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen.
This comes as a surprise, given Trump’s expression of support for Le Pen during the election campaign, which concluded with a Macron victory on May 7.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he thought Le Pen was the “strongest on borders,” and “the strongest on what’s been going on in France,” though he stopped short of endorsing her.

Le Pen had a similar campaign to Trump’s successful 2016 bid, running on a fiercely anti-immigration platform packaged in populist rhetoric. But as it is well known, Trump is no fan of a loser, which may explain his desire correct the record and confess his long-time support of Macron.",president donald trump congratulated newly elected french president emmanuel macron brief photo op u embassy brussels remarked macron tremendous victory great honor newly elected president france ran incredible campaign tremendous victory trump said world talking lot discus including terrorism thing congratulation great job added intense handshake trump also reportedly told macron preferred candidate face president far right opponent marine le pen come surprise given trump expression support le pen election campaign concluded macron victory may interview associated press trump said thought le pen strongest border strongest going france though stopped short endorsing le pen similar campaign trump successful bid running fiercely anti immigration platform packaged populist rhetoric well known trump fan loser may explain desire correct record confess long time support macron,donald trump congratulated newly elected french president emmanuel macron brief photo op u embassy brussels remarked macron tremendous victory great honor newly elected president france ran incredible campaign tremendous victory trump said world talking lot discus including terrorism thing congratulation great job added intense handshake trump also reportedly told macron preferred candidate face president far right opponent marine le pen come surprise given support le pen election campaign concluded macron victory may interview associated
2535,"President Donald Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that he had been a supporter in his race against far-right leader Marine Le Pen, although Trump's only comment on the race had him hailing Le Pen.

Trump told Macron of his views in comments relayed by an official in the French government's office – after a bilateral meeting where the two men engaged in a vigorous handshake that lasted more than five seconds.

'You were my guy,' Trump assured the new French president during their first time meeting in Brussels, the official from the French president's office said, according to French media reports.

Trump told Macron that, contrary to media reports during the race, he had not backed Le Pen and had followed Macron's campaign with great attention, the source said, adding that the two leaders had spoken in English.

'She's the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France,' Trump said.

The pop queen, known for her shocking antics, made the remark Tuesday while opening for comedian Amy Schumer in New York.

“If you vote for Hillary Clinton,” Madonna told the crowd at Madison Square Garden, “I will give you a blow job.”
“And I’m good,” the 58-year-old “Like a Virgin” singer, an outspoken supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee, said to cheers from the audience.

“I’m not a tool. I take my time,” Madonna boasted.

Madonna has made a point of rooting on the former secretary of State’s White House bid, posting several pro-Clinton messages on Twitter.

The entertainer’s comments at Schumer’s show come just days after the comic made headlines for telling supporters of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump who booed her to leave a performance.

2539,"Eggs are the Dr. Jekylll and Mr. Hyde of the breakfast world. One day they’re a diet darling, chockful of healthy fats, vitamin E, and protein. The next thing you hear: Eggs are bad for you—as bad as cigarettes, in fact, according to a recent study in the journal Atherosclerosis.

First, here’s the deal on that new study. Researchers from Western University in Canada  examined over 1,200 men and women to come to the conclusion that regularly eating egg yolks was two-thirds as bad as smoking when it comes to carotid plaque in the arteries, a known risk factor for stroke and heart attack.

But before you ditch the eggs, experts point out that this study doesn’t exactly give the whole picture. The main crack: The research shows an association between egg consumption and plaque buildup, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship, says cardiologist Gordon Tomaselli, MD from the American Heart Association. (In other words, there’s no way to tell which came first, the plaque or the egg.) The study also didn’t control for what else participants ate or take into account how much they exercised, which can play a big role in heart disease, Dr. Tomaselli says.

“While it’s interesting that the graphs of egg yolk consumption and smoking take a similar shape when looking at carotid plaque build-up, this study doesn’t take into account the many other adverse effects of smoking, namely high blood pressure and lung cancer,” says Dr. Tomaselli.

And your rise-and-shine scramble has more to it than just cholesterol: “Eggs contain many other nutrients, including unsaturated fats, which may be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease,” says Gregg Fonarow, MD, of UCLA Cardiology. “Whether the net effect of egg consumption is beneficial, neutral, or harmful requires assessing more than just measuring the cholesterol content of egg yolk,” he says.

Here, the bottom line on how to eat eggs healthily:

1. Skip the three-egg omelet. It’s safest to limit your egg consumption to one a day. The American Heart Association recommends that most people limit their daily cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams, and one yolk contains about 185 milligrams. If a single-egg scramble simply won’t cut it, eat extra whites. “This way you’ll get the protein from the whites without the added cholesterol of the yolk,” says Dr. Tomaselli.

2. Hold the bacon. One of the biggest oversights of this study is that it didn’t account for the other foods in a person’s diet—and anyone who’s ever ordered a Grand Slam knows that eggs usually come with side dishes that aren’t exactly good for you, says Marisa Moore, RD, from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Her advice? Pair your egg with fresh fruit, whole grain toast, and veggies instead of fennel sausage, a greasy hash, and bacon.

3. Snack smart. That cookie you’ve got your eye on? Well that has egg in it too. “You have to be cognizant that other dishes contain eggs and cholesterol,” says Dr. Tomaselli. When your next snack attack rolls around, reach for a handful of nuts, which are rich in heart-healthy Vitamin E, monounsaturated fats, and fiber. (Check out 5 more high-protein snacks.)

4. Put ’em out to pasture. It pays to be choosy about which type of eggs you pick up at the supermarket. A 2010 study from Penn State University showed that hens who were kept outside on pastures rather than in a cage laid eggs that had twice as much vitamin E and 2.5 times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids than the eggs from  their cooped-up counterparts. To make sure you’ve got the right ones, look for the word “pastured” on the carton. And as always, organic is best.

2540,"Is your breakfast omelet harming your heart? A recent study by researchers at Western University in Canada found that the more egg yolks people ate, the thicker their artery walls became — an indicator of heart disease risk — and that the effect was almost as bad as from smoking cigarettes.

In the study, the researchers measured carotid plaque build-up in the arteries of 1,231 men and women, average age 62, who were seeking care at cardiovascular-health clinics. Participants filled out questionnaires detailing lifestyle habits including medication use, cigarette smoking and egg-yolk consumption. The researchers gauged how much people smoked and how many egg yolks they ate over time, by calculating their “pack-years” (the number of packs of cigarettes people smoked per day multiplied by the number of years they spent smoking) and “egg-yolk years” (how many egg yolks they ate per week for how many years).

After about age 40, participants’ plaque began building up steadily, but among the participants who ate the most eggs — three or more yolks per week — that build-up increased “exponentially,” the study found. As people’s egg-yolk years went up, so did their plaque accumulation — an association that was independent of factors like gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking, body mass index and diabetes.

(MORE: Good News, Kids Cholesterol Levels Are Down)

Among the 20% of participants who ate the most eggs, the carotid plaque build-up was about two-thirds that of the study’s heaviest smokers. The researchers concluded that the plaque increase from eating eggs “follows a similar pattern to that of cigarette smoking.”

Arterial accumulation of plaque is a key risk factor for heart attack and stroke. As plaque builds up, it thickens artery walls and narrows the space through which blood can flow, forcing the heart to pump harder. If plaques become unstable, they can break off and form clots, which can halt blood flow to either the brain or the heart, causing stroke or heart attack.

The authors argue that their findings should quell doubts over the link between high dietary cholesterol and heart disease. “The prevailing tendency to ignore dietary cholesterol as a risk factor for coronary heart disease requires reassessment, including the consumption of cholesterol from eggs,” the authors wrote.

The government’s dietary guidelines recommend that adults consume no more than 300 mg of cholesterol a day. One whole egg contains about 180 mg of cholesterol, nearly two-thirds of your daily recommended ma.

“The mantra ‘eggs can be part of a healthy diet for healthy people’ has confused the issue. It has been known for a long time that a high cholesterol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular events, and egg yolks have a very high cholesterol content,” study author Dr. David Spence, a professor of neurology at western’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, said in a statement. “In diabetics, an egg a day increases coronary risk by two- to five-fold.

2541,"PROBLEM: Last year, the average American consumed 247 eggs -- over 40 percent more than the world per-capita average. Because egg yolks are high in cholesterol, eating whole eggs increases cholesterol, a known risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart attacks. Previous research also links CAD with cigarette smoke.

METHODOLOGY: Canadian researchers examined 1,231 patients at London's Health Sciences Centre's University Hospital. The average age of all the patients was 62. Ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries established the presence and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque, and the scans were accompanied by lifestyle surveys. Smoking was measured in pack-years (number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years spent smoking). Egg yolk consumption was measured in egg yolk-years.

RESULTS: Aging was associated with a linear increase in arterial plaque after age 40, but smoking and egg consumption were each independently associated with an exponential increase in plaque. Egg consumption had two-thirds of the effect of smoking.

CONCLUSION: Egg yolks are almost as bad for your carotid arteries as smoking.

IMPLICATION: While the link between eggs and cholesterol -- and between cholesterol and heart disease -- is well established, this study sheds light on the extent of their potential harm if eaten routinely in large quantities. A single large egg contains more than 180 mg of cholesterol -- more than a third of a person's daily recommended intake. By this measure, a typical American breakfast alone, with two eggs (plus bacon!), would push well past that. Egg whites, meanwhile, remain excellent.

2542,"Remember the ‘70s when doctors equated eggs with cholesterol and heart disease? A recent Canadian study involving over 1,200 adults published in the peer-reviewed journal Atherosclerosis says that eating eggs yolks is about as bad as smoking cigarettes when it comes to advancing coronary heart disease. We’re already seeing cracks in the theory.

In the study, researchers recorded the number of eggs eaten and packs of cigarettes smoked as recalled by each adult (average age 62).  Everyone in the study had been referred to a vascular prevention clinic at a Canadian hospital, meaning their heart health (and the habits that led them there) was already in question. The researchers found that, as expected, plaque build-up in their subjects’ carotid artery thickened with age, and even correlated with smoking and egg-eating habits.


Publications like The Daily Mail and Fox News have reported blindly on the matter, but thankfully there are others out there suspiciously raising eyebrows.

The UK’s National Health Service points out some of the study’s limitations, including:

The accuracy of the participants’ recollections of egg yolk consumption.
A lack of details regarding how the eggs were cooked (or not).
Disregard for other factors of heart disease advancement, including but not limited to exercise, alcohol consumption, antidepressant use (antidepressants have been shown to cause arteries to thicken 400% faster than aging,) and other important dietary factors.
Neither the study in question nor the NHS takes into consideration, however:

The harmful effects of the chemicals and hormones found in non-organic eggs.
The effects on the human body from eating eggs from chicken given GMO feed.
The living condition of the chickens.
Non-organic eggs can contain the same antibiotics, chemicals, and hormones administered to conventional chickens. Add GMO feed, polluted water, and unsanitary living conditions to these chickens, and you may have eggs that are little more than hard-shelled pellets of poison.

Organic eggs from healthy chickens on GMO-free feed have actually shown in many studies to prevent heart disease. They contain healthful amounts of protein, vitamin B, omega-3 fatty acids, and many nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin, which reduce risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of blindness.

The key? Moderation, as with most things, and buying organic eggs from local farmers who can raise their chickens in truly cage-free conditions.

2543,"Conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease.

But a hundred years ago, fewer than than one in one hundred Americans were obese, and coronary heart disease was unknown.

The Procter and Gamble started marketing Crisco as a new kind of food -- the first commercially marketed trans fat. Crisco was originally used to make candles and soap, but with electrification causing a decline in candle sales,

Procter and Gamble decided to promote the fat as a “healthier” all-vegetable-derived shortening

According to LewRockwell.com:

“Feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores, like rats and dogs, does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them ...

In fact, it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease ...

The last word on this subject should go to Julia Child ... Enjoy eating saturated fats, they’re good for you!”





Dr. Mercola's Comments:
The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality. His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since. Fortunately, the truth is finally starting to come out, as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys' findings.

Time to Put Ancel Keys' Theory to Rest
Keys based his theory on a study of six countries, in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease. However, he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory. Had he chosen a different set of countries, the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.

And, as illustrated in the featured article, when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study, you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease.

Furthermore, many have now realized that it's the trans fat found in margarine, vegetable shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain, causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could!

Still, despite the scientific evidence, the low-fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities. Case in point: the most recent food chart issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December of last year, recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake—down from its previously recommended 10 percent…

Newer Studies Debunk Keys' Theory
The USDA's lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today, which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet. For example, as discussed in the featured article, a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high-saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease.

These include:

Tribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat
Maasai tribe in Kenya/Tanzania Meat, milk, cattle blood 66 percent
Inuit Eskimos in the Arctic Whale meat and blubber 75 percent
Rendille tribe in NE Kenya Camel milk, meat, blood 63 percent
Tokealu, atoll islands in New Zealand territory Fish and coconuts 60 percent
And then there's human breast milk, which contains 54 percent saturated fat. Since breast milk is the most perfect diet in existence for developing infants, the presence of high amounts of saturated fat cannot easily be construed as a ""mistake.""

Furthermore:

A meta-analysis published last year, which pooled data from 21 studies and included nearly 348,000 adults, found no difference in the risks of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat.
In a 1992 editorial published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, Dr. William Castelli, a former director of the Framingham Heart study, stated:

""In Framingham, Mass., the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate, the lower the person's serum cholesterol. The opposite of what… Keys et al would predict…We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, ate the most saturated fat, ate the most calories, weighed the least and were the most physically active.""
Another 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients, such as carbohydrates.

When you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity, increase triglycerides and small LDL particles, and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol. The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake, and weight reduction.
I believe that last point is very important, and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase in obesity, heart disease and diabetes. And once you can pinpoint the problem, turning it all around becomes that much easier.

Carbohydrates, Not Fat, is the Root of Obesity and Heart Disease
Heart disease is so common today, it's hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago, this disease was really uncommon.  As Dr. Donald Miller writes in the featured article:

""There were 500 cardiologists practicing in the U.S. in 1950. There are 30,000 of them now – a 60-fold increase for a population that has only doubled since 1950.""

Such an explosion of heart disease indicates that something has changed that is contributing to this epidemic.

What is that ""something""?

Our diet!

Most likely, the studies that have linked the so-called ""Western diet"" to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health. Because although the Western diet is high in red and processed meats and saturated fats, it's also alarmingly high in sugar and refined carbs like bread and pasta. And, as concluded in the last study listed above, when you reduce saturated fat and increase refined carbohydrates, you end up promoting obesity, heart disease and diabetes...

Gary Taubes has also done an excellent job of explaining the connection between carbs and obesity and its related health issues in his book Why We Get Fat: and what to do about it.

In a nutshell, eating fat and protein does not make you fat—carbohydrates do.I firmly believe the two primary keys for successful weight management and reducing your risk for diabetes, heart disease and other weight-related health problems are:

Severely restricting carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, and grains) in your diet, and
Increasing healthy fat consumption
According to last year's Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the top 10 sources of calories in the American diet are:

Grain-based desserts (cakes, cookies, donuts, pies, crisps, cobblers, and granola bars) 139 calories a day
Alcoholic beverages
Yeast breads, 129 calories a day
Pasta and pasta dishes
Chicken and chicken-mixed dishes, 121 calories a day
Mexican mixed dishes
Soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks, 114 calories a day
Beef and beef-mixed dishes
Pizza, 98 calories a day
Dairy desserts

Looking at this list, it plain to see that CARBS—i.e. sugars (primarily fructose) and grains—are the primary sources of our weight- and health problems, not saturated fats.

(As an update, you've often heard me state that soda is the number one source of calories in the US diet, which it was—based on the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The updated NHANES survey above covers nutritional data from 2005-2006, placing grain-based foods in the top two slots. Still, soda comes in at number four, and I still believe a lot of people, particularly teenagers, probably get a majority of their calories from fructose-rich drinks like soda.)

The Different Types of Fat
Fats can be confusing, but you can generally divide fats into four types:

Saturated fats, from animal fat and tropical oils
Monounsaturated fat, such as olive oil
Polyunsaturated fat, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fats
Trans fats, such as margarine
Sources of healthy fats include:

Olives and Olive oil Coconuts and coconut oil Butter made from raw grass-fed organic milk
Raw Nuts, such as, almonds or pecans Organic pastured egg yolks Avocados
Grass fed meats Palm oil Unheated organic nut oils
Another healthful fat you want to be mindful of is animal-based omega-3. Deficiency in this essential fat can cause or contribute to very serious health problems, both mental and physical, and may be a significant underlying factor of up to 96,000 premature deaths each year. For more information about omega-3's and the best sources of this fat, please review this previous article.

Having the proper balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fats is also very important for optimal health. So in addition to increasing your omega-3 (which most people are sorely deficient in), you also want to decrease your consumption of omega-6, found primarily in:

Corn oil
Soy oil
Canola oil
Safflower oil
Sunflower oil
The ideal ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is 1:1, but the typical American diet is more like 1:20 in favor of omega-6. The overabundance of these oils in processed foods of all kinds explains our excess omega-6 levels.

The other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats. Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify. This process, known as hydrogenation, makes fats less likely to spoil, so foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and also have a less greasy feel. The end result of the hydrogenation process is a completely unnatural fat that causes dysfunction and chaos in your body on a cellular level.

Your Body NEEDS Saturated Fat for Optimal Function
Saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources provide a number of important health benefits. In fact, your body cannot function without saturated fats! Saturated fats are needed for the proper function of your:

Cell membranes Heart Bones (to assimilate calcium)
Liver Lungs Hormones
Immune system Satiety (reducing hunger) Genetic regulation
Healthy Fat Tips to Live By
So please remember, you do need a certain amount of healthy fat, while at the same time you'll want to avoid the unhealthy varieties. The easiest way to accomplish this is to simply eliminate processed foods, which are high in all things detrimental to your health: sugar, carbs, and dangerous types of fats.

After that, these tips can help ensure you're eating the right fats for your health:

Use organic butter made from raw grass-fed milk instead of margarines and vegetable oil spreads. Butter is a healthy whole food that has received an unwarranted bad rap.
Use coconut oil for cooking. It is far superior to any other cooking oil and is loaded with health benefits. (Remember that olive oil should be used COLD, drizzled over salad or fish, for example, not to cook with.)
Following my nutrition plan will automatically reduce your modified fat intake, as it will teach you to focus on healthy whole foods instead of processed junk food.
To round out your healthy fat intake, be sure to eat raw fats, such as those from avocados, raw dairy products, and olive oil, and also take a high-quality source of animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil.",conventional medical authority say consumption saturated animal fat bad cause heart disease hundred year ago fewer one one hundred american obese coronary heart disease unknown procter

2544,"We’ve been told that saturated fat is unhealthy.

It is claimed to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks.

However… many recent studies suggest that the true picture is more complicated than that.

This article takes a detailed look at saturated fat and whether it is good or bad for your health.

What is Saturated Fat?

“Fats” are macronutrients.

That is, nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy.

Each fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids… which can be either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.

What this “saturation” stuff has to do with, is the number of double bonds in the molecule.

Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds.

This picture here shows the difference:

Saturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source.

Another way to phrase this, is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully “saturated” with hydrogen (H) atoms.

Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil, palm oil and dark chocolate.

Actually, “fats” contain a combination of different fatty acids. No fat is pure saturated fat, or pure mono- or polyunsaturated.

Even foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats (1).

Fats that are mostly saturated (like butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, while fats that are mostly unsaturated (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature.

Like other fats, saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram.

Bottom Line: Saturated “fats” are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature.
Why do People Think That it is Harmful?

A Single Butter Curl

Back in the 20th century, there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America.

It used to be a rare disease, but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death… which it still is (2).

Researchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream.

This was an important finding at the time, because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.

This led to the following assumption being made:

If saturated fat raises cholesterol (A causes B) and cholesterol causes heart disease (B causes C), then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease (A causes C).

However, at the time, this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans.

This hypothesis (called the “diet-heart hypothesis”) was based on assumptions, observational data and animal studies (3).

The diet-heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977, before it was ever proven to be true (4).

Even though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong, people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk.

Bottom Line: Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood. However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.
Saturated Fat Can Raise LDL (The “Bad”) Cholesterol, But Also HDL (The “Good”) Cholesterol

It’s important to realize that the word “cholesterol” is often used inaccurately.

Older Male Doctor

HDL and LDL, the “good” and “bad” cholesterols, aren’t actually cholesterol… they are proteins that carry cholesterol around, known as lipoproteins.

LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein. All “cholesterol” is identical.

At first, scientists only measured “Total” cholesterol, which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL. Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk, HDL was linked to reduced risk (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

“Total” cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL. So having a high HDL (protective) actually contributes to a high “Total” cholesterol.

Because saturated fat raised LDL levels, it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease. But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL.

All that being said, new research has shown that LDL isn’t necessarily “bad” because there are different subtypes of LDL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16):

Small, dense LDL: These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily, which drives heart disease.
Large LDL: These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and don’t easily penetrate the arteries.
The small, dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized, which is a crucial step in the heart disease process (17, 18, 19).

People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles (20).

So… if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease, we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible.

Here’s an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by “mainstream” nutritionists… eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large (21, 22, 23).

What this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.

Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren’t as dramatic as you may think. Although they increase LDL in the short-term, plenty of long-term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels (24, 25, 26).

It also seems to depend on the “chain length” of the fatty acid. For example, palmitic acid (16 carbons) may raise LDL, while stearic acid (18 carbons) does not (27).

Now scientists have realized that it’s not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles, but the number of LDL particles (called LDL-p) floating in the bloodstream.

Low-carb diets, which tend to be high in saturated fat, can lower LDL-p, while low-fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL-p (28, 29, 30, 31).

Bottom Line: Saturated fats raise HDL (the “good”) cholesterol and change LDL from small, dense (bad) to Large LDL, which is mostly benign. Overall, saturated fats do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believed.
Does Saturated Fat Cause Heart Disease?

Old Man Taking Pills

The supposedly harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines.

Because of that, this topic has received enormous amounts of funding.

However… despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, scientists still haven’t been able to demonstrate a clear link.

Several recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies, found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease.

This includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347,747 participants, published in 2010. Their conclusion: there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease (32).

Another review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies (both observational studies and controlled trials) with a total of 643,226 participants. They found no link between saturated fat and heart disease (33).

We also have a systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration, which combines data from numerous randomized controlled trials.

According to their review, published in 2011, reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease (34).

However, they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events (but not death) by 14%.

This does not imply that saturated fats are “bad,” just that certain types of unsaturated fats (mostly Omega-3s) are protective, while saturated fats are neutral.

So… the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link. It was a myth all along.

Unfortunately, the governments and “mainstream” health organizations seem reluctant to change their minds and continue to promote the old low-fat dogma.

For more, read this review of 5 recent studies on saturated fat and health.

Bottom Line: The link between saturated fat and heart disease has been studied intensely for decades, but the biggest and best studies show that there is no statistically significant association.
Does a Diet Low in Saturated Fat Have Any Health Benefits, or Help You Live Longer?

Frustrated Young Woman With Vegetables on a Plate

Several massive studies have been conducted on the low-fat diet.

This is the diet recommended by the USDA and mainstream health organizations all over the world.

The main purpose of this diet, is to reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.

This diet also recommends increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains… along with reduced consumption of sugar.

The Women’s Health Initiative was the biggest nutrition study in history. It was a randomized controlled trial with 46,835 women, who were instructed to eat a low-fat diet.

After 7.5-8 years, there was only 0.4 kg (1 pound) difference in weight and there was zero difference in heart disease, cancer or death (35, 36, 37, 38).

Other massive studies have confirmed this… the low-fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death (39, 40).

Several studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oils showed that more people in the vegetable oil groups ended up dying (41, 42).

It is interesting to see that since the low-fat guidelines came out, the prevalence of obesity has skyrocketed (43):

Low Fat Guidelines and Obesity Epidemic

This graph shows that the obesity epidemic started full-force at the same time the low-fat advice was peaking. The type 2 diabetes epidemic followed soon after.

Of course, this graph alone doesn’t prove anything (correlation does not equal causation), but it does make sense that replacing traditional foods like butter and meat with processed low-fat foods high in sugar had something to do with it.

It’s also interesting when looking at the literature, that in almost every single study comparing the “expert approved” low-fat diet to other diets (including paleo, vegan, low-carb and Mediterranean), it loses (44, 45, 46, 47).

Bottom Line: Studies on the low-fat diet do not show a reduced risk of heart disease or death and some studies show that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils increases the risk.
People With Certain Medical Conditions May Want to Minimize Saturated Fat

Suspicious Doctor

The results of most studies are based on averages.

The studies clearly show that, on average, saturated fat does not raise the risk of heart disease.

However, within those averages, there is room for individual variability.

Perhaps most individuals see no effect… while others experience decreased risk and yet others experience an increased risk.

That being said, there are definitely some people who may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet.

This includes individuals with a genetic disorder called Familial Hypercholesterolemia, as well as people who have a gene variant called ApoE4 (48).

With time, the science of genetics will most surely discover more ways in which diet affects our individual risk for disease.

Bottom Line: Some people may want to minimize saturated fat intake, including people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia or a gene called ApoE4.
Saturated Fat is Excellent for Cooking and Foods That Are High in it Tend to be Healthy and Nutritious

Saturated fat has some important beneficial aspects that are rarely mentioned.

Chef Holding Bell Pepper and Meat

For example, saturated fats are excellent for cooking. Because they have no double bonds, they are highly resistant to heat-induced damage (49).

Polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, easily oxidize when they’re heated (50).

For this reason, coconut oil, lard and butter are all excellent choices for cooking, especially for high-heat cooking methods like frying.

Foods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious, as long as you’re eating quality unprocessed foods.

These include naturally fed/raised meats, dairy products from grass-fed cows, dark chocolate and coconuts.

Bottom Line: Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious.
The “Bad” Fats You Should Avoid Like The Plague

Bottles of Vegetable Oil

There are many different types of fat.

Some of them are good for us, others neutral, yet others are clearly harmful.

The evidence points to saturated and monounsaturated fats being perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy.

However… the situation is a bit more complicated with polyunsaturated fats.

When it comes to those, we have both Omega-3s and Omega-6s.

We need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance, but most people are eating way too many Omega-6 fatty acids these days (51).

It is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega-3s (such as from fatty fish), but most people would do best by reducing their Omega-6 consumption (52).

The best way to do that is to avoid seed- and vegetable oils like soybean and corn oils, as well as the processed foods that contain them.

Another class of fats, artificial trans fats, is also very harmful.

Trans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat, hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst.

Studies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease (53, 54, 55, 56).

So eat your saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and Omega-3s… but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague.

Bottom Line: The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids.
Blaming New Health Problems on Old Foods Doesn’t Make Sense

The health authorities have spent an immense amount of resources studying the link between saturated fat and heart disease.

Despite thousands of scientists, decades of work and billions of dollars spent, this hypothesis still hasn’t been supported by any good evidence.

The saturated fat myth wasn’t proven in the past, isn’t proven today and never will be proven… because it’s just flat out wrong.

Not only is this myth NOT supported by scientific evidence, it is easily refuted with some plain common sense…

Humans and pre-humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, but the heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago.

2545," Saturated fats have long been called ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart. But a new analysis calls into question whether they're really that bad after all.

The findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, have sparked renewed debate about fats and heart health.

The new study should trigger a review of current diet guidelines for heart health, according to the researchers who did the analysis. Other experts, including one from the American Heart Association, disagree.

There is some common ground. All agree that dietary fat is just one factor that drives heart disease risk. Paying attention to the other factors is also important.

WebMD asked a study co-author, a cardiologist, a nutrition expert, and the American Heart Association to elaborate.

What did the analysis look at and find?

Researchers looked at 72 published studies on fats and heart disease. The studies involved more than 600,000 people from 18 countries. Some people already had heart disease, while others did not. The researchers reanalyzed the results, an approach called a meta-analysis.

They looked at whether different fats helped or hurt your heart. The different fats included:

Saturated fats (found in meats, whole-fat dairy products, and baked goods)
Polyunsaturated fats, such as omega-3 and omega-6 (found in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils)
Monounsaturated fats (found in olive and canola oils)
Trans fats (found in fried foods and baked goods, and being phased out of the food supply)
The surprise? Saturated fats, long thought to raise heart disease risks, had no effect. Neither did monounsaturated fats, which are thought to help the heart, says study researcher Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, at the Harvard School of Public Health.

Which fats did have an effect? Trans fats, known to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, were linked with a higher risk of heart disease, as expected. Omega-3s from food helped. Omega-6s appeared to help.

What do the researchers say about the findings?

Nutritional guidelines on fats and heart health by such organizations as the American Heart Association may deserve another look, the study authors say.

The focus should move beyond just the fat content of food, Mozaffarian says. ""We can't judge the healthfulness of a food [only] by how many grams of saturated fat it has. We really should be moving toward a food-based analysis.

""It's not just the fat grams, and the type of food, but the way the food is processed,"" he says. For instance, the analysis found that a type of saturated fat linked with milk and dairy products reduced heart disease risk.

Based on the analysis, Mozaffarian and his colleagues say, the current heart health guidelines that promote eating more foods with omega-3s and omega-6s and less of those with saturated fats are not needed.

What do others say?

Other experts find fault with the study and its conclusions.

""Mainly I think the findings should be disregarded,"" says Walter Willett, MD, chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. While the analysis suggests that ''saturated fat is not quite as bad as its reputation, it depends on what you compare it to,"" he says.

""If you replace saturated fat with carbohydrates or refined starch or sugar, you are not changing your heart disease risk,"" he says. ''If you replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, you do get a reduction in heart disease risk.""

One analysis is not enough to change dietary advice, says James Blankenship, MD, director of cardiology at Geisinger Medical Center.

In the analysis, the researchers themselves cite a number of caveats and limitations, such as study participants self-reporting their fat intake.

In response to the study, the American Heart Association says its guidelines remain the same. For heart health, it recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, and unsaturated fats.

Less than 6% of the diet should include saturated and trans fats, the association says.

Is there some common ground about how to protect heart health?

Yes.

Judging how heart-healthy a food is must take more than fat into account, Mozaffarian says. For instance, a lower-fat meat that is processed is not heart-healthy, he says.

Willett agrees. ""It's important to look at single nutrients, but also at whole food groups,"" he says. Blankenship offers these steps proven to benefit the heart:

Get regular exercise -- at least a half-hour a day.
Maintain a healthy body weight.
See your doctor and find out your heart disease risk. Know your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
""Don't spend so much time looking at food labels,"" Blankenship says. Instead, he says, go to the grocery store's produce department and load up.

If cholesterol and saturated fat don't play as large a role as we thought in heart disease, what's behind the heart disease problem?

Multiple factors, Blankenship says. They include obesity, genetics, sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure. A poor diet drives risk, he says, ""but it's not the only thing.""

Mozaffarian reports receiving fees from Bunge, Pollock Institute, Quaker Oats, Life Sciences Research Organization, Foodminds, Nutrition Impact, Amarin, Astra Zeneca, Winston and Strawn LLP, and UpToDate, and serving on the scientific advisory board for Unilever North America.

2546,"Poor old saturated fat. For over forty years now, it’s been spoken of only in hushed tones, dissed as nothing but artery clogging, obesity-causing poison. This “common sense fact” has become so widely accepted that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchasing skim milk, ditching their egg yolks, and beginning a life free of steak, pork, and butter.

It’s time to bring bacon back to breakfast. After all, saturated fat is good for you.

We’ve Made a Huge Mistake

But we all make mistakes. This one started in 1970, with the first publication of “The Seven Countries Study .” The research looked at the incidences of saturated fat intake and heart disease among 12,763 men from (you guessed it) seven different countries, and showed a correlation between the two.

Unfortunately, the study was deeply flawed: It didn’t take into account important factors like smoking rates, sugar consumption, and exercise levels, and it left out an awful lot of data from other countries that contradicted the conclusions. The study’s authors actually had access to twenty-two countries’ data, and didn’t discuss any of the populations that followed diets with plenty of saturated fat and barely experienced any heart disease. Such communities include the Kenyan Masai, the Tokelau in Polynesia, and the Arctic Inuit.

Governments followed by making the supposed saturated fat-heart disease connection a matter of public health policy, an ideology which probably culminated with the abominable food pyramid of the 1990s — which recommended up to 11 servings of rice and pasta per day, and about as little fat as possible.

The result? In the past 30 years in the United States, the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from 40 percent to 30 percent, while obesity has doubled and heart disease has remained the country’s number one killer.

But the spread of obesity has no single cause; there are a lot of complicated factors that have led to America’s health crisis. To figure out whether saturated fat should be added back into our diets, let’s take a closer look at its effect on the body.

Why Saturated Fat Doesn't Cause Heart Disease

In a 2010 evaluation of 21 studies and 350,000 subjects, saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease — and numerous other studies have reached similar conclusions        . Of course, these studies aren’t without controversy. For instance, Greatist expert and physician Dr. James Hardeman believes those 21 studies aren’t comprehensive enough; on average, their subjects were studied for around 14 years, which may not be long enough to see the effects of a diet high in saturated fat. However, they raise important questions about saturated fat’s effects on the arteries of the heart and brain.


PIN IT
But what about cholesterol? We actually have two kinds of cholesterol in our blood: the HDL (“good”) and LDL (“bad”). Total cholesterol levels are less important than the ratio of HDL to LDL, but a simpler (if kind of flawed) approach is that we should try to increase HDL and decrease LDL. Saturated fat is generally believed to increase the bad cholesterol.

But that’s only part of the story, because there are also two kinds of LDL cholesterol: big, floaty particles (type A) and small, dense ones (type B). When someone reduces their consumption of saturated fat and their LDL cholesterol “drops,” they’re only lowering their type A particles. But it’s the type B particles that are more closely linked in heart disease, and they’re generally controlled by carbohydrate consumption . So the best way to cut out harmful types of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that’s low in carbs, rather than fat        .

Why Saturated Fat Can Be Good For You

Saturated fat has been shown to have loads of positive effects on the body, including:

Liver Health: Saturated fat encourages the liver cells to dump their fat cells, which helps the liver to function more effectively  .
Immunity: Saturated fatty acids, especially the kinds found in butter and coconut, help white blood cells to recognize and destroy invading viruses and bacteria. Go get ‘em, boys!
Hormones: Eating saturated fat tends to increase free testosterone levels, which helps to repair tissue, preserve muscle, and improve sexual function  .
Now, fat is high in calories, so it can promote weight gain in that respect. Per gram, it has more than twice the calories of protein or carbohydrates. But provided an eye is kept on portion size, saturated fat in and of itself doesn’t have any negative impact on the body. In fact, increasing fat intake might help with weight loss: One study found that when three groups of obese people were fed diets of 90 percent fat, 90 percent protein, and 90 percent carbohydrates, respectively, the high-fat group lost the most weight . Plus, it tastes freaking delicious.

DROP THAT HOT DOG!

This doesn’t mean every source of saturated fat is healthy. Case in point: A study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that after analyzing the diets of 1.2 million people, there was no association between eating red meat and heart disease — but there was for those who ate a lot of processed meat . That is to say, if we’re going to get sick from eating meat or saturated fat, it’ll be by getting it from a crappy source.

Basically, we should spend a little more on food. The body loves saturated fat, but from sources like grass-fed meat and butter, whole eggs, and coconut fat — not hot dogs and pepperoni pizza (sorry). By a mile, the biggest enemy in our food is likely refined sugar . Even the American Heart Association, which is still anti-saturated fat, agrees that sugar is a far bigger contributor to heart disease.

But the tide is very slowly starting to turn. Prominent journals and scientists are beginning to speak out on saturated fat’s benefits, and, after government scientists reviewed 16,000 studies on diet and obesity, Sweden recently became the first Western country to advocate a high-fat diet to its citizens.

2547,"Saturated fat has been a controversial subject in recent years, with some research suggesting that it may not be as bad for health as once thought. But a new study published in The BMJ dashes any hope that butter is actually back.

Cutting down on saturated fatty acids—found in animal foods, like dairy and meat, as well as palm and coconut oil—may lower risk of coronary heart disease, according to researchers. And swapping these foods for unsaturated fats (from vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and seafood, for example), whole grains, and plant-based proteins (think lentils and edamame) seems to boost heart health even further.

The new findings are significant because saturated fat has been a source of debate: Studies have shown that saturated fatty acids can affect cholesterol, but there's hasn't been any definitive research linking them to overall heart health. A large meta-analysis published this summer, for example, found that butter consumption does not appear to raise heart disease risk.

The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats, saying they should make up no more than 10% of total calories. Qi Sun, MD, assistant professor of nutrition in the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the new study, says his group’s findings back up this advice.

The new study also bolsters government recommendations for “eating an overall healthful diet,"" Dr. Sun told Health—one that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, vegetable cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats (the two main types of unsaturated fats), nuts, legumes, fish, and low-fat dairy.

To determine saturated fat’s long-term effects on heart health, he and his colleagues followed more than 73,000 women and 42,000 men for an average of 26 years, collecting data on their diet and health every four years.

After controlling for factors such as age, ethnicity, and other potential influencers, the researchers found that participants who consumed the most calories from four commonly consumed saturated fatty acids—lauric acid, myristic acid, plametic acid, and stearic acid—were 18% more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consumed the least.

Some researchers have suggested putting individual limits on each of these fatty acids, said co-author Frank Hu, PhD, professor of nutrition and epidemiology, in a press release. But that’s not practical, he argues, since they share many of the same food sources: red meat, dairy fat, butter, lard, and palm oil.

RELATED: Good Fats, Bat Fats: How to Choose

Instead, it is healthier to focus on lowering total saturated fat intake, says Hu. In fact, the researchers estimated that replacing just 1% of those fats with the same number of calories from poly- or monounsaturated fats (think avocado and nuts), whole grains, or plant-based proteins could reduce heart disease risk by 4% to 8%.

The study specifically recommends swapping animal fats (butter and lard) with vegetable oils high in unsaturated fat; and points out that restaurant food, and snacks and bakery items—including crackers, chips, popcorn, cakes, and cookies—can be high in saturated fat.

The researchers also offer some insight as to why prior studies haven't always shown a clear link between less saturated fat intake and better heart health. Often, the authors say, people who cut back on saturated fat replace those calories with low-quality carbs, like processed food and refined flour. These are associated with health risks of their own, and likely cancel out any health benefits.

This is the largest observational study to-date to examine the association between specific saturated fatty acids and the risk of coronary heart disease, say the authors, and its results are in line with previous research that has focused specifically on healthy swaps.

While the findings aren’t terribly surprising, they do serve one important purpose: As Hu put it, “this study dispels the notion that ‘butter is back.'""",saturated fat controversial subject recent year research suggesting may bad health thought new study published bmj dash hope butter actually back cutting saturated fatty acid found animal food like dairy meat well palm coconut oil may lower risk coronary heart disease according researcher swapping food unsaturated fat vegetable oil nut seed avocado seafood example whole grain plant based protein think lentil edamame seems boost heart health even new finding significant saturated fat source debate study shown saturated fatty acid affect cholesterol definitive research linking overall heart health large meta analysis published summer example found butter consumption appear raise heart disease risk current u dietary guideline taken conservative approach saturated fat saying make total calorie qi sun md assistant professor nutrition harvard h chan school public health senior author new study say group finding back advice related healthy high fat food eat new study also bolster government recommendation eating overall healthful diet dr sun told health one includes fruit vegetable whole grain vegetable cooking oil rich polyunsaturated fat monounsaturated fat two main type unsaturated fat nut legume fish low fat dairy determine saturated fat long term effect heart health colleague followed woman men average year collecting data diet health every four year controlling factor age ethnicity potential influencers researcher found participant consumed calorie four commonly consumed saturated fatty acid lauric acid myristic acid plametic acid stearic acid likely develop coronary heart disease course study consumed least researcher suggested putting individual limit fatty acid said co author frank hu phd professor nutrition epidemiology press release practical argues since share many food source red meat dairy fat butter lard palm oil related good fat bat fat choose instead healthier focus lowering total saturated fat intake say hu fact researcher estimated replacing fat number calorie poly monounsaturated fat think avocado nut whole grain plant based protein could reduce heart disease risk study specifically recommends swapping animal fat butter lard vegetable oil high unsaturated fat point restaurant food snack bakery item including cracker chip popcorn cake cooky high saturated fat researcher also offer insight prior study always shown clear link le saturated fat intake better heart health often author say people cut back saturated fat replace calorie low quality carbs like processed food refined flour associated health risk likely cancel health benefit related worst food trans fat largest observational study date examine association specific saturated fatty acid risk coronary heart disease say author result line previous research focused specifically healthy swap finding terribly surprising serve one important purpose hu put study dispels notion butter back,fatty acid found animal food like dairy meat well palm coconut oil may lower risk coronary heart disease according researcher swapping food unsaturated fat vegetable oil nut seed avocado seafood example whole grain plant based protein think lentil edamame seems boost heart health even new finding significant saturated fat source research linking overall heart health .
2548,"A workout so intense that it worries some professionals is set to become the fitness trend of 2014. High intensity training (HIT) used to be the preserve of the most dedicated fitness fanatics but is heading into the mainstream, with one of the UK's largest gym companies capitalising on its popularity.

Fitness First is launching Tabata classes containing a four-minute form of HIT in 50 of its London gyms this month before rolling out the classes nationwide to its 180,000 members in the new year.

The chain claims the Tabata method has been ""scientifically proven to be the most effective way to increase both aerobic and anaerobic fitness"". Its website cites tests using the system which it says increased VO2 max – the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise – by 13% in six weeks. It says a trial using 30-second ""bursts of intensity"" with two-minute rest periods was not as effective.

Japanese scientist Professor Izumi Tabata gave his name to the method while working with his country's Olympic speed-skating team. His routine consisted of a combination of 20 seconds of intense exercise, followed by 10 seconds of rest to a rotation lasting four minutes.

Fitness First's website states: ""Professor Tabata's latest research shows that if [his regime] is followed correctly, the body will continue to consume more calories for up to 12 hours after the exercise class. These are additional calories to those consumed by the body at rest – so over and above the so-called RMB or Resting Metabolic Rate.""

The dangers of HIT training, especially for people who are middle-aged, was highlighted this year when Andrew Marr said that the stroke which almost killed him occurred in the middle of an intense workout on his rowing machine at home.

Fitness First's online promotion does include an advisory note for anyone considering the Tabata class to consult a doctor before beginning the routines, especially if they have existing medical conditions. A spokesman said the 10-minute warm-up followed by a four-minute Tabata rotation ""will reap the same benefits as an hour on an exercise bike cycling at moderate rate"".

Cardiologist and fitness enthusiast Dr Aseem Malhotra questioned if HIT is the best form of exercise. ""Although I don't object in principle to high intensity training, there is no long-term data into its benefits. People exercise for all different reasons,"" he said. ""Some like to push their body to the limits, others do it competitively, but for the majority it's for improving overall health. No one can doubt the multitude of benefits of regular exercise, and as a regular gym enthusiast myself I know of the benefits as much as anyone. But, like anything, too much exercise can be a bad thing, with good data revealing that the greatest cardiovascular benefit for running was up to 20 miles a week at a moderate pace. If you ran more than this at a faster pace the benefits started to get lost.""

A study of up to 10,000 former Olympic athletes published in the British Medical Journal revealed that in disciplines with high-intensity activity, such as cycling, boxing and rowing, competitors did not live longer than those at low-intensity sports such as cricket and golf. ""In fact, those athletes who engaged in high intensity physical contact sports had a higher mortality than those in the lowest intensity,"" said Malhotra. ""For the majority of the population, improving longevity and general health can be done by brisk walking for 20 minutes three times a week – and doesn't involve spending money joining a gym.""

HIT's surge in popularity was highlighted by a recent survey of almost 30,000 people for the American College of Sports Medicine, which showed that, although once the workout of choice for twenty and thirtysomethings, older people and non-fitness enthusiasts planned to attempt the regime in 2014. Last year HIT did not appear in the top 20 of the ACSM's annual list predicting fitness trends, but this year it is number one.Professor Walt Thompson from the University of Georgia and lead author of the ACSM report said: ""We've never seen something introduced to the market and catch on so fast.""",workout intense worry professional set become fitness trend high intensity training hit used preserve dedicated fitness fanatic heading mainstream one uk largest gym company capitalising popularity fitness first launching tabata class containing four minute form hit london gym month rolling class nationwide member new year chain claim tabata method scientifically proven effective way increase aerobic anaerobic fitness website cite test using system say increased vo max maximum rate oxygen consumption exercise six week say trial using second burst intensity two minute rest period effective japanese scientist professor izumi tabata gave name method working country olympic speed skating team routine consisted combination second intense exercise followed second rest rotation lasting four minute fitness first website state professor tabata latest research show regime followed correctly body continue consume calorie hour exercise class additional calorie consumed body rest called rmb resting metabolic rate danger hit training especially people middle aged highlighted year andrew marr said stroke almost killed occurred middle intense workout rowing machine home fitness first online promotion include advisory note anyone considering tabata class consult doctor beginning routine especially existing medical condition spokesman said minute warm followed four minute tabata rotation reap benefit hour exercise bike cycling moderate rate cardiologist fitness enthusiast dr aseem malhotra questioned hit best form exercise although object principle high intensity training long term data benefit people exercise different reason said like push body limit others competitively majority improving overall health one doubt multitude benefit regular exercise regular gym enthusiast know benefit much anyone like anything much exercise bad thing good data revealing greatest cardiovascular benefit running mile week moderate pace ran faster pace benefit started get lost study former olympic athlete published british medical journal revealed discipline high intensity activity cycling boxing rowing competitor live longer low intensity sport cricket golf fact athlete engaged high intensity physical contact sport higher mortality lowest intensity said malhotra majority population improving longevity general health done brisk walking minute three time week involve spending money joining gym hit surge popularity highlighted recent survey almost people american college sport medicine showed although workout choice twenty thirtysomethings older people non fitness enthusiast planned attempt regime last year hit appear top acsm annual list predicting fitness trend year number one professor walt thompson university georgia lead author acsm report said never seen something introduced market catch fast,exercise intense worry professional set become fitness trend high intensity training hit used preserve dedicated fitness fanatic heading mainstream one uk largest gym company capitalising popularity fitness first launching tabata class containing four minute form hit london gym month rolling class nationwide member new year chain claim tabata method scientifically proven effective way increase aerobic anaerobic fitness website cite test using system say increased vo max maximum rate oxygen consumption exercise six week say trial using second burst intensity two minute rest period effective japanese scientist professor
2549,"It is hailed as the best way to get fit, with celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Katie Holmes purporting to be fans.

High intensity training - or HIIT as it is known -  is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training.

But, if a person isn’t accustomed to this form of exercise, the workouts could be doing more harm than good, experts have warned.

They revealed exhausting high intensity training can increase a person’s risk of heart disease and cancer.

These work-outs also weaken the body’s ability to fight off free radicals – which are the harmful chemicals that alter DNA and can lead to a host of illnesses.

2550,"Vanilla exercise is passé. Fitness fan-atics are putting some Shades of Grey into their workouts, opting for short, sharp, punishing regimes that promise to get you twice as fit in half the time of a regular gym session. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) sessions can last for just 20 minutes. Spend 30 seconds pushing your body and metabolism out of its comfort zone by working out as hard as you can — say, by sprinting — then recover with lighter exercise, such as jogging, for 20 seconds before powering up again. And again and again.

Studies have shown that within months, even weeks, the body’s systems can adapt positively to the increases in stress and as a result fitness improves enormously. Research suggests that these regimes can help to reduce blood sugar levels and offset Type 2 diabetes, as well as improving strength, endurance and muscle tone. So no more excuses for those previously claiming to be ‘too busy’ to work out.

And yet, despite the evidence, controversy is now clouding this intense exercise phenomenon. With the BBC presenter Andrew Marr’s revelation that he believes his recent stroke was linked to intense interval training on a rowing machine, there is a fear that HIIT can cause more harm than good, because what all variations of these workouts share (some focus on strength, others on cardio) is that they are punishing to the extreme. So you have to be reasonably fit to begin with in order to try them safely. This, say experts, is where some people are going wrong. ‘These types of sessions are not suitable for everyone,’ says Greg Whyte, professor of applied sport and exercise science at Liverpool John Moores University. ‘You need to have a good fitness background before you even take part. Pushing yourself to those limits is strongly inadvisable if you are in any way unfit or have underlying problems.’

People mistakenly think that because they last for just a few minutes, these workouts are an easy option. Don’t be fooled. Steve Barrett, a personal trainer who has worked with leading athletes, says, ‘They should leave you feeling as if you literally couldn’t do anything more.’ And that degree of effort, says Dr Dominic Micklewright, director of the sport, performance and fatigue research unit at the University of Essex, can mean ‘there is almost certainly an increased risk of injury among untrained people with this sort of approach’. Couple intense workouts with minimal calorie intake or fasting and you could find yourself suffering more for your fitness than you imagined; with blood sugar levels too low to sustain you through these workouts, headaches, muscle weakness and nausea or feeling faint could result.

None of this means that, as long as you are fit enough, the high-intensity approach should be avoided. Barrett uses it with some of his fitter clients and says it should be employed two to four times a week, in addition to run-of-the-mill activities such as steady running, cycling or swimming. And most experts agree that, if you build up to it, interval training of some sort is essential for fitness progression, but that a watered-down version of HIIT is more appropriate for the masses. Exercise scientists at McMaster University in Canada recently tried a ‘gentler’ version of a HIIT schedule, involving a minute of effort followed by a minute of easy recovery repeated ten times over 20 minutes, on a group including some previously unfit volunteers. All displayed remarkable improvements in overall health and fitness after several weeks. ‘With any exercise, the key thing is to feel like you’ve worked hard, but not to the point that you are in extreme physical discomfort or pain,’ says Barrett. ‘You do need to push yourself harder in order to progress, but it should be effort that is just within the realms of your ability. Always listen to your body.’",vanilla exercise pas fitness fan atics putting shade grey workout opting short sharp punishing regime promise get twice fit half time regular gym session hiit high intensity interval training session last minute spend second pushing body metabolism comfort zone working hard say sprinting recover lighter exercise jogging second powering study shown within month even week body system adapt positively increase stress result fitness improves enormously research suggests regime help reduce blood sugar level offset type diabetes well improving strength endurance muscle tone excuse previously claiming busy work yet despite evidence controversy clouding intense exercise phenomenon bbc presenter andrew marr revelation belief recent stroke linked intense interval training rowing machine fear hiit cause harm good variation workout share focus strength others cardio punishing extreme reasonably fit begin order try safely say expert people going wrong type session suitable everyone say greg whyte professor applied sport exercise science liverpool john moore university need good fitness background even take part pushing limit strongly inadvisable way unfit underlying problem people mistakenly think last minute workout easy option fooled steve barrett personal trainer worked leading athlete say leave feeling literally anything degree effort say dr dominic micklewright director sport performance fatigue research unit university essex mean almost certainly increased risk injury among untrained people sort approach couple intense workout minimal calorie intake fasting could find suffering fitness imagined blood sugar level low sustain workout headache muscle weakness nausea feeling faint could result none mean long fit enough high intensity approach avoided barrett us fitter client say employed two four time week addition run mill activity steady running cycling swimming expert agree build interval training sort essential fitness progression watered version hiit appropriate mass exercise scientist mcmaster university canada recently tried gentler version hiit schedule involving minute effort followed minute easy recovery repeated ten time minute group including previously unfit volunteer displayed remarkable improvement overall health fitness several week exercise key thing feel like worked hard point extreme physical discomfort pain say barrett need push harder order progress effort within realm ability always listen body,john moore university need good fitness background even take part pushing limit strongly inadvisable way unfit underlying problem people mistakenly think last minute workout easy option fooled steve barrett personal trainer worked leading athlete say leave feeling literally anything degree effort say dr dominic micklewright director sport performance fatigue research unit university essex mean almost certainly increased risk injury among untrained people sort approach couple intense workout minimal calorie intake fasting could find suffering fitness imagined blood sugar level low sustain workout headache muscle weakness nausea
2551,"Many people with chronic health problems resign themselves to lives of modest activity or no activity at all, thinking vigorous exercise is unsafe or that they lack the stamina for it. But recent studies are proving just the opposite.

They are showing that high-intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, pulmonary disease, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease.

The studies strongly suggest that a more demanding but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise known as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is not only safe for most patients but more effective at preventing or reversing the deficits associated with many chronic ailments.

Although once reserved for athletes seeking a competitive advantage and for healthy people wanting to burn more body fat, HIIT is now being studied as a treatment that is sometimes as effective as medication for many people with chronic health problems.

Researchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods, interspersed with periods of rest, is more effective than continuous moderate activity at improving cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and mechanical functions.

Instead of continuous movement for 20 or more minutes, as is typical for exercise walkers, joggers and cyclists, HIIT usually involves 30 to 60 seconds of exercise near the peak of a person’s ability, followed by a comparable recovery period of easy activity, with the sequence repeated for a total of about 20 minutes three times a week.

“We know that exercise is good for people at risk of chronic disease, but people tend not to exercise,” said Jonathan P. Little, a specialist in exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia at Okanagan. Yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise, making it more likely that people will continue it on their own.

Various activities can be adapted to interval training, including cycling, swimming, walking and jogging, especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill. But HIIT is possible indoors and out, for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise.

The intensity is tailored to an individual’s starting ability. “The high-intensity component is set at 80 to 90 percent of the person’s maximum aerobic capacity,” Dr. Little said. Researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically.

However, high-intensity exercise, even just half a minute at a time, is not appropriate for everyone. In a recent report in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal, Dr. Little; his wife, Mary E. Jung, also at the University of British Columbia; and Marcus W. Kilpatrick of the University of South Florida wrote that HIIT “is only appropriate for low-risk individuals, moderate-risk individuals who have been cleared for vigorous intensities by a medical professional, and high-risk individuals who are under direct medical supervision during exercise training.”

Among the physiological benefits of HIIT are the body’s increased ability to use oxygen and insulin, as well as arteries that are more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve.

“We’ve seen, for example, that interval training is remarkably effective at lowering glucose levels in people with diabetes,” Dr. Little said in an interview. “Just one session improves a person’s glucose level.”

A 12-week controlled study in Denmark of high-intensity interval walking for patients with Type 2 diabetes showed it helped control blood glucose levels better than continuous moderate exercise, even though the same number of calories was expended by both groups. Interval training also was more effective at enhancing the patients’ physical fitness and reducing body fat relative to lean muscle tissue.

By making blood vessels better able to expand, HIIT can improve the cardiovascular system’s ability to respond to added exertion. Oxygen-carrying blood can flow more smoothly through arteries that are wide open, which also reduces the risk of a vessel-blocking clot.

The body’s ability to use oxygen efficiently improves markedly “after as little as two weeks of training” with HIIT, the researchers wrote. Peak oxygen uptake — the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise — is considered the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patients.

“Too many people think incorrectly that high-intensity exercise is only for athletes, that it’s a heart attack waiting to happen,” Dr. Little said. On the contrary, the research strongly suggests, it is more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack.

In a 2012 report reviewing the effects of HIIT in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, researchers in Canada, France and Switzerland wrote that “HIIT appears safe and better tolerated by patients than moderate-intensity continuous exercise” and more effective at increasing patients’ peak oxygen uptake, blood vessel flexibility and pumping ability of the heart.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often unable to exercise long enough to gain needed health benefits. But they can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort, researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens have reported.

Stroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT. As rehabilitation specialists at the University of Cincinnati wrote this month in BioPortfolio, stroke patients with residual weakness “enter a vicious cycle of limited activity and deconditioning.” But while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health, preliminary studies, including one in Trondheim, Norway, suggest that patients do even better with HIIT. The Norwegian team reported that the improvements persisted for months after the six-week high-intensity exercise program ended.

And Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinson’s disease patients to move their arms and legs. The researchers, from the University School of Physical Education in Krakow, Poland, showed in 11 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s symptoms that eight weeks of HIIT, three times a week, on a stationary bike had a global benefit, improving both lower and upper body function.

Reductions in rigidity and stiffness correlated with an increase in a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which the researchers suggested could have stimulated the growth and function of nerves normally influenced by dopamine, the neurotransmitter that declines in Parkinson’s disease.

2552,"President Trump has told multiple people, including EPA head Scott Pruitt, that he intends to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, according to a new Axios report based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. Earlier Saturday, Trump announced on Twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week. Over the past three days, European leaders and even Pope Francis have lobbied Trump to support the agreement, but while leaders from the six other nations in the G7 signed a statement reaffirming their commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions on Saturday, Trump abstained. “The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very unsatisfying,” announced German chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly frustrated with Trump’s indecision during the talks.

Axios adds that it’s possible Trump will impulsively change his mind, as Trump has done after telling people he would do something in the past; Axios also points out that all of Trump’s options for withdrawing from the deal would require as much as a year to carry through on, allowing for some additional uncertainty.

Speaking of uncertainty, in a Face the Nation interview set to air on CBS Sunday, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.” Speaking with the New York Times, Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, also made it sound as if Trump was still making up his mind after “a lot of give-and-take between the different countries” at the G7 summit. But according to Axios’s sources, Trump has already made his decision to ditch the pact, and that would definitely be consistent with his numerous past statements as one of the world’s most notorious deniers of the consensus scientific conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of global climate change. He also said during his presidential campaign that he would cancel the deal and has infamously and repeatedly called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese (and scientists) — but Trump says a lot of things and has, at least a few times, also hinted that he understood the threat of climate change.

President Obama helped negotiate the historic Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was officially ratified by the U.S. and 194 other signatories last year. Should Trump leave the pact, the U.S. would be the first country to exit, which would also be the second time that America has signed onto a global climate deal under a Democratic president only to walk away from the same agreement under a Republican predecessor, as President George W.

America’s exit from the Paris Agreement wouldn’t invalidate the accord, which still has the support of most of the world, including China, and is likely to proceed without U.S. participation. But the failure of the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, being the world’s second-highest producer of such pollution, will worsen and likely accelerate an already dangerous problem.

2553,"President Trump has privately told multiple people, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, that he plans to leave the Paris agreement on climate change, according to three sources with direct knowledge.

Publicly, Trump's position is that he has not made up his mind and when we asked the White House about these private comments, Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks said, ""I think his tweet was clear. He will make a decision this week.""

Why this matters: Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could to do unravel Obama's climate policies. It also sends a stark and combative signal to the rest of the world that working with other nations on climate change isn't a priority to the Trump administration. And pulling out threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal, given how integral former President Obama was in making it come together in the first place.

Caveat: Although Trump made it clear during the campaign and in multiple conversations before his overseas trip that he favored withdrawal, he has been known to abruptly change his mind — and often floats notions to gauge the reaction of friends and aides. On the trip, he spent many hours with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, powerful advisers who back the deal.

Behind-the-scenes: The mood inside the EPA this week has been one of nervous optimism. In a senior staff meeting earlier this week, Pruitt told aides he wanted them to pump the brakes on publicly lobbying for withdrawal from Paris.

Instead, the EPA staff are quietly working with outside supporters to place op eds favoring withdrawal from Paris.
The White House has told Pruitt to lay off doing TV appearances until Trump announces his decision on Paris. (In past weeks, the EPA Administrator has gone on TV to say the U.S. needs to quit Paris, but Pruitt told aides he'll be keeping a lower profile. He doesn't want a Paris withdrawal to be seen as his victory. ""It needs to be the President's victory,"" one source said, paraphrasing what Pruitt has told aides.)
Pruitt's aides have told associates in recent days that they remain confident the President will withdraw from Paris but they've been worried about him being overseas and exposed to pressure from European leaders and the environmentalist views of his top aides like Ivanka and economic adviser Gary Cohn. Top EPA staff were relieved when Trump refused to join the other six nations of the G7 in reaffirming ""strong commitment"" to the Paris agreement.
One level deeper: If Trump follows through and announces publicly he plans to withdraw from the Paris deal, an administration official laid out three ways he could do that:

Trump could announce he is pulling the U.S. from the deal, which would trigger a withdrawal process that wouldn't conclude until November 2020 at the earliest. Under the deal's terms, any country can't send notice of its intent to withdraw until three years after the deal entered into force, which was Nov. 4, 2016. The actual process of withdrawal would then take one year. In this time, it's feasible Trump could change his mind, the administration source said.
Trump could declare that the Paris deal is actually a legal treaty that requires Senate approval. Such a vote would fail, and then Trump would have Senate backing to not abide by the deal, which he deems a treaty. A letter that 22 Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, sent to Trump this week urging him to withdraw from the deal, increases the odds of this happening, the source said. Trump could also call for a Senate vote in combination with either the first or third option.
Trump could withdraw the U.S. from the treaty that underpins the Paris deal, which is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This would be the most extreme option because it would take the U.S. out of all global climate diplomacy. This process would take just one year.
Will we always have Paris? All of these scenarios take more time and maneuvering than a simple announcement, which ensures the debate about what to do with the climate deal won't be over with any time soon.",president trump privately told multiple people including epa administrator scott pruitt plan leave paris agreement climate change according three source direct knowledge publicly trump position made mind asked white house private comment director strategic communication hope hick said think tweet clear make decision week matter pulling paris biggest thing trump could unravel obama climate policy also sends stark combative signal rest world working nation climate change priority trump administration pulling threatens unravel ambition entire deal given integral former president obama making come together first place caveat although trump made clear campaign multiple conversation overseas trip favored withdrawal known abruptly change mind often float notion gauge reaction friend aide trip spent many hour ivanka trump jared kushner powerful adviser back deal behind scene mood inside epa week one nervous optimism senior staff meeting earlier week pruitt told aide wanted pump brake publicly lobbying withdrawal paris instead epa staff quietly working outside supporter place op ed favoring withdrawal paris white house told pruitt lay tv appearance trump announces decision paris past week epa administrator gone tv say u need quit paris pruitt told aide keeping lower profile want paris withdrawal seen victory need president victory one source said paraphrasing pruitt told aide pruitt aide told associate recent day remain confident president withdraw paris worried overseas exposed pressure european leader environmentalist view top aide like ivanka economic adviser gary cohn top epa staff relieved trump refused join six nation g reaffirming strong commitment paris agreement one level deeper trump follows announces publicly plan withdraw paris deal administration official laid three way could trump could announce pulling u deal would trigger withdrawal process conclude november earliest deal term country send notice intent withdraw three year deal entered force nov actual process withdrawal would take one year time feasible trump could change mind administration source said trump could declare paris deal actually legal treaty requires senate approval vote would fail trump would senate backing abide deal deems treaty letter senate republican including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell sent trump week urging withdraw deal increase odds happening source said trump could also call senate vote combination either first third option trump could withdraw u treaty underpins paris deal called united nation framework convention climate change would extreme option would take u global climate diplomacy process would take one year always paris scenario take time maneuvering simple announcement ensures debate climate deal time soon,scott pruitt plan leave paris agreement climate change according three source direct knowledge publicly trump position made mind asked white house private comment director strategic communication hope hick said think tweet clear make decision week matter pulling paris biggest thing trump could unravel obama climate policy also sends stark combative signal rest world working nation climate change priority trump administration pulling threatens unravel ambition entire deal given integral former president obama making come together first place caveat although trump made clear campaign multiple
2554,"Donald Trump’s intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday, as one report cited “confidants” saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue”.

Trump said in a tweet on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!”

The message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal, which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year.

A report from the Axios news outlet, however, cited “three sources with direct knowledge” as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal.

In an interview broadcast on CBS’s Face the Nation, meanwhile, defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had “obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard”.

He added: “And I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in … and I’m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.”

Mattis said that as defense secretary, such negotiations were “not inside my portfolio”, but added: “Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that’s just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.”

The White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning, however, the president offered comment of his own, via Twitter, that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report.

“It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,” the president wrote. “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names it is very possible that those sources don’t exsist [sic] but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!”

2555,"Jonathan Swain and Amy Harder at Axios reported on Sunday morning that President Donald Trump has told ""confidants"" that he has made the decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords, and will make an announcement soon, most likely this coming week.  This report will certainly produce a major backlash from the anti-fossil fuel lobby in the U.S. and globally, which correctly views the commitments made by former President Barack Obama under this executive agreement as the main driving force for increasingly restrictive regulations of the U.S. fossil fuel industries.

But this report, if true, should surprise no one after the President was the only G7 leader who refrained from endorsing the Paris Accords on Saturday, a move that came after one of his advisers had told the media that Mr. Trump's views related to Paris were ""evolving.""  This statement was taken by many Paris supporters as an indication that the President might be moving towards changing his mind and keeping the U.S. in the agreement after all.

Such hope by Paris supporters has always seemed like a pipe dream, though, since the Obama commitments within the Paris accord stand in direct opposition to the commitments made by candidate Trump during the 2016 campaign, as well as the energy policy-related actions taken by President Trump since assuming office.

During his campaign, Candidate Trump made pledges to pull the U.S. out of two Obama-era executive agreements - Paris and Iran - centerpieces of his daily stump speech.  At every campaign stop, every fundraising event, every one of the campaign rallies before audiences of thousands of people, Donald Trump overtly promised to end U.S. involvement in both of those agreements, which he regularly referred to as ""terrible deals"" made by ""stupid"" people.  Indeed, this was the overarching theme of his entire campaign - that he is a superior negotiator who would be able to negotiate better deals than these for the country.

Any expectation that he would now, after being pressured by his European peers, suddenly decide that Paris is a fine ""deal"" that the U.S. can now live under seems overly optimistic, to say the least.  It would comparable to Sherlock Holmes, after years of demonizing Dr. Moriarty as the worst villain on the face of the earth, suddenly deciding he's a really cool guy with whom he'd love to have a few beers.

Then there is the reality that, as President, Mr. Trump has already issued a series of executive orders and signed Congressional Review Act resolutions that either reverse outright or order the EPA and Department of Interior (DOI) to rescind or rewrite a raft of Obama-era regulations and executive decisions for which the commitments in the Paris Accords serve as the main underpinnings.

The Clean Power Plan, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) venting and flaring regulation, EPA's methane regulations and stricter ozone standard, higher gas mileage requirements for auto makers, the Council of Environmental Quality's (CEQ) ""social cost of carbon and methane"" construct, the presidential directive to all agencies to consider climate change implications in all permitting, planning and leasing decisions - all of these Obama-era actions and more were considered to be key elements of U.S. efforts to meet commitments Mr. Obama made under the Paris agreement.

2556,"President Donald Trump has reportedly told multiple people in private that he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.

Though Trump has publicly said he has not yet made up his mind, Axios reports he has privately told several people of his decision, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

The outlet spoke with three sources who confirmed the information, though Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute.

Trump tweeted Saturday morning to say he would announce his 'final decision' on whether or not the US will stay in the Paris agreement next week despite coming under intense pressure from world leaders at the G7 in Sicily.

'I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!' he wrote.

The president earlier declined to comment about the accord, as he refused to give into intense international pressure.

Within the Environmental Protection Agency, staffers are quieting down on public lobbying and Pruitt will have fewer television appearances about the issue so that the withdrawal will be 'the President's victory', according to Axios.

There are also concerns within the EPA that Trump could be influenced by the pressures he received overseas, according to the outlet. Earlier Saturday, the other members of the G7 voted to abide by the Paris climate agreement, according to a person familiar with the talks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before the formal announcement.

The leaders attempted to convince Trump for three days - first in Brussels at meetings of NATO and the European Union, then in Sicily for G7, but the former reality television host left Italy without making clear where he stands.

Under the G7 agreement, the Trump administration will be given more time to consider whether it will remain committed to the 2015 Paris deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.

Backing out of the climate accord had been a central plank of Trump's campaign and aides have been exploring whether they can adjust the framework of the deal even if they do not opt out entirely.",president donald trump reportedly told multiple people private withdraw u paris climate agreement though trump publicly said yet made mind axios report privately told several people decision including epa administrator scott pruitt outlet spoke three source confirmed information though trump known change mind last minute trump tweeted saturday morning say would announce final decision whether u stay paris agreement next week despite coming intense pressure world leader g sicily make final decision paris accord next week wrote president earlier declined comment accord refused give intense international pressure within environmental protection agency staffer quieting public lobbying pruitt fewer television appearance issue withdrawal president victory according axios also concern within epa trump could influenced pressure received overseas according outlet earlier saturday member g voted abide paris climate agreement according person familiar talk person spoke condition anonymity discus matter formal announcement leader attempted convince trump three day first brussels meeting nato european union sicily g former reality television host left italy without making clear stand g agreement trump administration given time consider whether remain committed paris deal rein greenhouse gas emission backing climate accord central plank trump campaign aide exploring whether adjust framework deal even opt entirely,trump reportedly told multiple people private withdraw u paris climate agreement though trump publicly said yet made mind axios report privately told several people decision including epa administrator scott pruitt outlet spoke three source confirmed information though trump known change mind last minute trump tweeted saturday morning say would announce final decision whether u stay paris agreement next week despite coming intense pressure world leader g sicily make final decision paris accord next week wrote president earlier declined comment
2557,"President-elect Donald J. Trump has not been inaugurated yet, but he's already backtracking on some of his most high-profile campaign positions.

The latest walk-back concerns global climate change: specificallys the agreement that world leaders recently put in place to rein in emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.

In an interview on Tuesday with senior reporters and editors of the New York Times, Trump said he has ""an open mind"" on whether to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement. “I’m looking at it very closely,"" he said

During the campaign, Trump was quite clear on this. During an energy policy speech on May 26, Trump said: “We’re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.""

During U.N. climate talks that ended this week, China emerged as the new leader on the issue if the U.S. were to stop mobilizing international support for climate action, as it has under President Obama.

The Paris Climate Agreement entered into force on Nov. 4, 2016, and sets a goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels through 2100.

It also contains an even more stringent target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, through 2100 in order to limit climate impacts on small island countries and other vulnerable nations.

In Trump's discussion with the Times, Trump said he is also keeping his mind open about whether global warming is mainly due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, or other causes.


Scientists, of course, settled this matter long ago, with the debate within the climate community now focused on just how severe the consequences of human-caused climate change will be, rather than whether the phenomenon exists in the first place.

Through his personnel decisions, Trump has given every indication that he plans to gut environmental regulations and boost fossil fuel production, including coal, which is the most carbon intensive fuel source.

Environmental groups are skeptical that Trump's statements on Tuesday represent much of a change.

""Actions speak louder than words,"" said 350.org executive director Mary Boeve in a statement. ""As long as Trump has a climate change denier like Myron Ebell running his transition team, you know this is all a bunch of empty rhetoric.""

""... Trump is going on about fantasies like ‘clean coal’ and flip-flopping around on whether there’s ‘some connectivity’ between humans and climate change. The President-elect needs to get up to speed, and fast.”

Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, pointed to Trump's shortlist for cabinet positions dealing with climate issues, such as oil tycoon Harold Hamm for Energy Secretary, as evidence there is not much of a shift taking place.

""We’re waiting for action, and Trump is kidding nobody on climate as he simultaneously stacks his transition team and cabinet with climate science deniers and the dirtiest hacks the fossil fuel industry can offer,"" Brune said.

2558,"A proposed secret communications back channel between Donald Trump's team and the Kremlin was reportedly intended to allow sensitive discussions about strategy in Syria, it was reported last night.

Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, at Trump Tower in December.

The back channel was intended to connect Michael Flynn, who was at the meeting and later became Mr Trump's first National Security Adviser, with Russian military leaders, the Associated Press reported. It came as the nascent Trump administration was developing its Syria policy before his inauguration. The communications would have used Russian diplomatic facilities and bypassed the US intelligence services.

Such a system was never established and after Rex Tillerson became Secretary of State the idea was reportedly dropped as Mr Trump's team decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels.

The discussion of a back channel involving Mr Kushner was first revealed by the Washington Post late on Friday. US officials reportedly learned about it by monitoring Russian communications. Mr Kislyak was said to have been ""taken aback"" by Mr Kushner's proposal.

It also emerged Mr Kushner had at least three interactions, including two phone calls, with Mr Kislyak, during and after the election, that had not been previously disclosed. The discussions reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and improving US-Russian economic relations

Mr Kushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick said: ""Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.""

She said Mr Kushner could not remember any calls with Mr Kislyak before the election. She added: ""Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period.""

According to Reuters Mr Kushner also met Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank and a trained intelligence officer appointed by Vladimir Purin, at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under US sanctions.

The White House declined to answer questions about Mr Kushner's meeting with Mr Kislyak.

But H.R. McMaster, who replaced Mr Flynn as National Security Adviser  said so-called ""back-channeling"" was completely normal. Asked if it would concern him if someone in the Trump administration tried to set up a back channel with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin, he replied: ""No"".

He said: ""We have back-channel communications with any number of individual countries. What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner.""

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating any links between the Trump campaign and Russia, asked the campaign to produce all Russia-related documents, including phone records and emails, dating back to its official start in June 2015.",proposed secret communication back channel donald trump team kremlin reportedly intended allow sensitive discussion strategy syria reported last night jared kushner mr trump son law senior adviser revealed proposed setting secret line meeting sergey kislyak russian ambassador trump tower december back channel intended connect michael flynn meeting later became mr trump first national security adviser russian military leader associated press reported came nascent trump administration developing syria policy inauguration communication would used russian diplomatic facility bypassed u intelligence service system never established rex tillerson became secretary state idea reportedly dropped mr trump team decided communicate moscow official channel discussion back channel involving mr kushner first revealed washington post late friday u official reportedly learned monitoring russian communication mr kislyak said taken aback mr kushner proposal also emerged mr kushner least three interaction including two phone call mr kislyak election previously disclosed discussion reportedly focused fighting terrorism improving u russian economic relation mr kushner lawyer jamie gorelick said mr kushner previously volunteered share congress know meeting contacted connection inquiry said mr kushner could remember call mr kislyak election added mr kushner participated thousand call time period according reuters mr kushner also met sergei nikolaevich gorkov head russian state owned bank vnesheconombank trained intelligence officer appointed vladimir purin trump tower december bank u sanction white house declined answer question mr kushner meeting mr kislyak h r mcmaster replaced mr flynn national security adviser said called back channeling completely normal asked would concern someone trump administration tried set back channel russian embassy kremlin replied said back channel communication number individual country allows communicate discreet manner meanwhile senate intelligence committee investigating link trump campaign russia asked campaign produce russia related document including phone record email dating back official start june,trump team kremlin reportedly intended allow sensitive discussion strategy syria reported last night jared kushner mr kushner mr kushner met sergey kislyak russian ambassador trump tower december back channel intended connect michael flynn meeting later became secretary state idea reportedly dropped mr trump team decided communicate moscow official channel discussion back channel involving mr kushner
2559,"Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.

Ambassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, son-in-law and confidant to then-President-elect Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.

The meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser.

The White House disclosed the meeting only in March, playing down its significance. But people familiar with the matter say the FBI now considers the encounter, as well as another meeting Kushner had with a Russian banker, to be of investigative interest.

Kislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.

Neither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials said.

The White House declined to comment. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

Russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U.S. analysts. But officials said that it’s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump.

Kushner’s apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with Moscow, rather than relying on U.S. government systems, has added to the intrigue surrounding the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia. The FBI closely monitors the communications of Russian officials in the United States, and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency monitors the communications of Russian officials overseas.

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner’s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary.

“How would he trust that the Russians wouldn’t leak it on their side?” said one former senior intelligence official. The FBI would know that a Trump transition official was going in and out of the embassy, which would cause “a great deal” of concern, he added. The entire idea, he said, “seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy.”

The discussion of a secret channel adds to a broader pattern of efforts by Trump’s closest advisers to obscure their contacts with Russian counterparts. Trump’s first national security adviser, Flynn, was forced to resign after a series of false statements about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose his own meetings with Kislyak when asked during congressional testimony about any contact with Russians.

Kushner’s interactions with Russians — including Kislyak and an executive for a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions — were not acknowledged by the White House until they were exposed in media reports.

It is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials. But new administrations are generally cautious in their handling of interactions with Moscow, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of waging an unprecedented campaign to interfere in last year’s presidential race and help elect Trump.

Obama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks.

The State Department, the White House National Security Council and U.S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual.

Trump’s advisers were similarly secretive about meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates. The Obama White House only learned that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi was flying to New York in December to see Kushner, Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, another top Trump adviser, because U.S. border agents in the UAE spotted the Emirate leader’s name on a flight manifest.

Russia would also have had reasons of its own to reject such an overture from Kushner. Doing so would require Moscow to expose its most sophisticated communications capabilities — which are likely housed in highly secure locations at diplomatic compounds — to an American.
The Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week, officials who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events.

For instance, according to those officials and the letter, Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials.

In addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a “Russian contact” in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter.

The Post reported in April that Erik Prince, the founder of the private security firm Blackwater, now called Academi, and an informal adviser to the Trump transition team, met on Jan. 11 — nine days

2560,"At this point, it almost feels like the Washington Post is trolling everyone with the amount of fake news they put out.

During the meeting wherein the Washington Post asserted that Jared Kushner proposed a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, it was actually the Russians who proposed it, a source close to Kushner informed Fox News.

The source alleges that the permanent back channel “was never discussed”. What really happened was the proposal of a one-off call about Syria.

Fox News reports:

A December meeting between Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration, and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at Trump Tower focused on Syria, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Monday.

During the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, not Kushner, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia.

The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.

In addition, the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russia’s contention the Obama administration’s policy on Syria was deeply flawed.

. . .

Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.

The fake news from the Washington Post just keeps coming and yet they are never to be held accountable for some reason.

JARED KUSHNER WANTED SECRET COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL WITH RUSSIA, NEW REPORT ALLEGES

Details of the meeting follow a NBC report that Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, is currently under FBI scrutiny as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.

Kislyak allegedly then relayed the suggestion to his superiors in Moscow. That was based on intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials, although neither the meeting nor the communications of the Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials told the Post.

The source has told Fox News that Kushner is eager to tell Congress about the meeting and any others of interest.",idea permanent back channel never discussed according source instead one call syria raised conversation addition source told fox news december meeting focused russia contention obama administration policy syria deeply flawed jared kushner wanted secret communication channel russia new report alleges detail meeting follow nbc report kushner married trump daughter ivanka currently fbi scrutiny part investigation possible collusion trump campaign russia kushner suggested use russian diplomatic facility way shield pre inauguration discussion kislyak monitoring according post kislyak allegedly relayed suggestion superior moscow based intercept russian communication reviewed u official although neither meeting communication american involved u surveillance official told post source told fox news kushner eager tell congress meeting others interest,syria raised conversation addition source told fox news december meeting focused russia contention obama administration policy syria deeply flawed jared kushner wanted secret communication channel russia new report alleges detail meeting follow nbc report kushner married trump daughter ivanka currently fbi scrutiny part investigation possible collusion trump campaign russia kushner suggested use russian diplomatic facility way shield pre inauguration discussion kisly
2562,"President Trump's son-in-law and now top White House advisor Jared Kushner proposed a secret back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team during a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat.

Kushner spoke with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about creating that line of communication to facilitate sensitive discussions aimed at exploring the incoming administration's options with Russia as it was developing its Syria policy, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke with the Associated Press.

The intent was to connect Trump's then-chief national security advisor Michael T. Flynn with Russian military leaders, said the source, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Russia, a pivotal player in Syria, has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad, often at the expense of civilians during a long civil war. The White House did not acknowledge the meeting or Kushner's attendance until March. At the time, a White House official dismissed it as a brief courtesy meeting.

Kushner's involvement in the proposed back channel was first reported by the Washington Post, which said he proposed using Russian diplomatic facilities for the discussions, apparently to make them more difficult to monitor.

The newspaper cited anonymous U.S. officials who were briefed on intelligence reports on intercepted Russian communications.

The Post wrote that Kislyak was reportedly taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.

According to the person familiar with the Kushner meeting, the Trump team eventually felt there was no need for a back channel once Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of State, and decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels. Tillerson was sworn in Feb. 1.

Flynn served briefly as Trump's national security advisor before being fired in February after officials said he misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he and the ambassador had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in a phone call.

Sally Yates, the former acting U.S. attorney general, told Congress this month that the deception left Flynn vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians. Flynn remains under federal investigation in Virginia over his foreign business ties and was interviewed by the FBI in January about his contacts with Kislyak.

The disclosure of the back channel put White House advisors on the defensive Saturday, as Trump wrapped up his first foreign trip as president, and led lawyers for Kushner to say he is willing to talk with federal and congressional investigators about his foreign contacts and his work on the Trump campaign.

Meeting with reporters in Sicily, two Trump advisors refused to address the contents of Kushner's December meeting with the Russian diplomat. But they did not dismiss the idea that the administration would go outside normal U.S. government and diplomatic channels for communications with other countries.

Speaking generally, national security advisor H.R. McMaster said “we have back channel communications with a number of countries.” He added: “It allows you to communicate in a discreet manner.”

In response to repeated questions from reporters, Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said, “We're not going to comment on Jared. We're just not going to comment.”

Kushner was a trusted Trump advisor last year, overseeing the campaign's digital strategy, and remains an influential confidant within the White House as does his wife, Ivanka Trump.

Federal investigators and several congressional committees are looking into any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, including allegations that there may have been collaboration to help Trump and harm his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

On Saturday, the Associated Press confirmed that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has requested information and documents from Trump's campaign.",president trump son law top white house advisor jared kushner proposed secret back channel kremlin trump transition team december meeting leading russian diplomat kushner spoke ambassador sergey kislyak creating line communication facilitate sensitive discussion aimed exploring incoming administration option russia developing syria policy according person familiar discussion spoke associated press intent connect trump chief national security advisor michael flynn russian military leader said source authorized publicly discus private policy deliberation spoke condition anonymity russia pivotal player syria backed syrian president bashar assad often expense civilian long civil war white house acknowledge meeting kushner attendance march time white house official dismissed brief courtesy meeting kushner involvement proposed back channel first reported washington post said proposed using russian diplomatic facility discussion apparently make difficult monitor newspaper cited anonymous u official briefed intelligence report intercepted russian communication post wrote kislyak reportedly taken aback suggestion allowing american use russian communication gear embassy consulate proposal would carried security risk moscow well trump team according person familiar kushner meeting trump team eventually felt need back channel rex tillerson confirmed secretary state decided communicate moscow official channel tillerson sworn feb flynn served briefly trump national security advisor fired february official said misled vice president mike penny whether ambassador discussed u sanction russia phone call sally yates former acting u attorney general told congress month deception left flynn vulnerable blackmailed russian flynn remains federal investigation virginia foreign business tie interviewed fbi january contact kislyak disclosure back channel put white house advisor defensive saturday trump wrapped first foreign trip president led lawyer kushner say willing talk federal congressional investigator foreign contact work trump campaign meeting reporter sicily two trump advisor refused address content kushner december meeting russian diplomat dismiss idea administration would go outside normal u government diplomatic channel communication country speaking generally national security advisor h r mcmaster said back channel communication number country added allows communicate discreet manner response repeated question reporter trump economic advisor gary cohn said going comment jared going comment kushner trusted trump advisor last year overseeing campaign digital strategy remains influential confidant within white house wife ivanka trump federal investigator several congressional committee looking connection russia trump campaign including allegation may collaboration help trump harm democratic opponent hillary clinton saturday associated press confirmed senate intelligence committee investigating russia meddling u presidential election requested information document trump campaign,president trump son law top white house advisor jared kushner proposed secret back channel kremlin trump transition team december meeting leading russian diplomat kushner spoke ambassador sergey kislyak creating line communication facilitate sensitive discussion aimed exploring incoming administration option russia developing syria policy according person familiar discussion spoke associated press intent connect trump chief national security advisor michael flynn russian military leader said source authorized publicly discus private
2563,"President Trump unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday after a finding by the Justice Department that he mishandled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails last year.

Trump said he acted based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who found that Comey improperly moved to ""usurp"" the attorney general's authority and decided not to prosecute Clinton.

""I have received the attached letters from the attorney general and deputy attorney general of the United States recommending your dismissal as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" Trump said in a letter to Comey. ""I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.""

""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump said. ""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

The Trump administration will immediately begin a search for Comey's successor. FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has been floated as a possible replacement, according to Fox News.

""The FBI is one of our nation's most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,"" Trump said in a White House statement.

In a memo explaining to Trump why he thought Comey should be fired, Rosenstein, who was sworn into office in late April, pointed to the FBI director's July press conference explaining why Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

""The director was wrong to usurp the attorney general's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors,"" Rosenstein wrote.

Comey's involvement in the 2016 general election didn't end there. On Oct. 28, just days before voters went to the polls, Comey sent a letter to Congress saying new emails had surfaced related to the investigation into whether Clinton had mishandled classified information.

Just over a week later, Comey said they had found no new wrongdoing by Clinton, but the candidate's staff has argued the Oct. 28 letter significantly hurt her campaign.

Days after Trump's inauguration in January, Trump memorably shook Comey's hand while meeting at the White House.",president trump unexpectedly fired fbi director james comey tuesday finding justice department mishandled investigation hillary clinton email last year trump said acted based recommendation attorney general jeff session deputy attorney general rod rosenstein found comey improperly moved usurp attorney general authority decided prosecute clinton received attached letter attorney general deputy attorney general united state recommending dismissal director federal bureau investigation trump said letter comey accepted recommendation hereby terminated removed office effective immediately greatly appreciate informing three separate occasion investigation nevertheless concur judgment department justice able effectively lead bureau trump said essential find new leadership fbi restores public trust confidence vital law enforcement mission wish best luck future endeavor trump administration immediately begin search comey successor fbi deputy director andrew mccabe floated possible replacement according fox news fbi one nation cherished respected institution today mark new beginning crown jewel law enforcement trump said white house statement memo explaining trump thought comey fired rosenstein sworn office late april pointed fbi director july press conference explaining democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton prosecuted use private email server secretary state director wrong usurp attorney general authority july announce conclusion case closed without prosecution function director make announcement director said fbi completed investigation presented finding federal prosecutor rosenstein wrote comey involvement general election end oct day voter went poll comey sent letter congress saying new email surfaced related investigation whether clinton mishandled classified information week later comey said found new wrongdoing clinton candidate staff argued oct letter significantly hurt campaign day trump inauguration january trump memorably shook comey hand meeting white house,president trump unexpectedly fired fbi director james comey tuesday finding justice department mishandled investigation hillary clinton email last year trump said acted based recommendation attorney general jeff session deputy attorney general rod rosenstein found comey improperly moved usurp attorney general authority decided prosecute clinton received attached letter attorney general deputy attorney general united state recommending dismissal director federal bureau investigation trump said letter comey accepted recommendation hereby terminated removed office effective
2564,"Just hours after the FBI sent a letter Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee clarifying his testimony in relation to the Hillary Clinton email scandal, FBI Director James Comey was fired.

""Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement. ""President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.""

Trump's letter terminating Comey quickly leaked online.

""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote. ""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.""

Here are a few reasons, both stated and possible, Comey may have been canned:

He hurt the FBI's reputation

A memorandum prepared by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommending Comey's termination kicks off with the fact that ""over the past year ... the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice.""

He mishandled the Clinton email investigation

Rosenstein writes that Comey should not have given a news conference last July recommending that Clinton, who used a private email server while secretary of state, not face criminal charges. The deputy attorney general writes that Comey should have turned his findings over to federal prosecutors. He also takes issue with Comey's decision to send a letter just days before the November election revealing newly discovered Clinton emails. ""When federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information,"" the letter states.

He broke with tradition

Rosenstein cites several attorneys general and other authorities who decried Comey's actions as a ""departure from the department's widely respected, nonpartisan traditions."" Rosenstein writes that ""we should reject the departure and return to the traditions.""

Trump doesn't like him

Simply judging from his tweets, the president and Comey have had a rocky relationship. As Axios laid out, Trump first criticized the director online in July after that fateful, aforementioned news conference. Trump used the hashtag #RiggedSystem. By October, when he was bringing attention to a new cache of Clinton emails, Trump loved him—but in November, when Comey said he hadn't actually found material that justified charges, the pendulum had swung again.

""You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks,"" Trump said at a rally. ""Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it.""

Trump is embarrassed by him

The president recently accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of wiretapping his phones during the campaign. Comey has shut down this allegation, explaining that Obama could not order a wiretap of anyone's phone unchecked.

""I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,"" Comey said in March. ""The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets.""

He knows something about Russia

Of course, the elephant in the room is the ongoing investigation into whether people associated with Trump's campaign had contact with Russia during the election. Comey confirmed the probe in March.

""We approach this work in an open-minded, independent way and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can, but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. ""I can promise you, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.""

Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, picked up on this after news of Comey's firing Tuesday, tweeting, ""Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation.""",hour fbi sent letter tuesday senate judiciary committee clarifying testimony relation hillary clinton email scandal fbi director james comey fired today president donald j trump informed fbi director james comey terminated removed office white house press secretary sean spicer said statement president trump acted based clear recommendation deputy attorney general rod rosenstein attorney general jeff session trump letter terminating comey quickly leaked online greatly appreciate informing three separate occasion investigation nevertheless concur judgment department justice able effectively lead bureau trump wrote essential find new leadership fbi restores public trust confidence vital law enforcement mission reason stated possible comey may canned hurt fbi reputation memorandum prepared deputy attorney general rod rosenstein recommending comey termination kick fact past year fbi reputation credibility suffered substantial damage affected entire department justice mishandled clinton email investigation rosenstein writes comey given news conference last july recommending clinton used private email server secretary state face criminal charge deputy attorney general writes comey turned finding federal prosecutor also take issue comey decision send letter day november election revealing newly discovered clinton email federal agent prosecutor quietly open criminal investigation concealing anything simply following longstanding policy refrain publicizing non public information letter state broke tradition rosenstein cite several attorney general authority decried comey action departure department widely respected nonpartisan tradition rosenstein writes reject departure return tradition trump like simply judging tweet president comey rocky relationship axios laid trump first criticized director online july fateful aforementioned news conference trump used hashtag riggedsystem october bringing attention new cache clinton email trump loved november comey said actually found material justified charge pendulum swung review new email eight day folk trump said rally hillary clinton guilty know fbi know people know trump embarrassed president recently accused predecessor barack obama wiretapping phone campaign comey shut allegation explaining obama could order wiretap anyone phone unchecked information support tweet looked carefully inside fbi comey said march department justice asked share answer department justice component department information support tweet know something russia course elephant room ongoing investigation whether people associated trump campaign contact russia election comey confirmed probe march approach work open minded independent way expert investigator conclude work quickly always well matter long take said according transcript remark promise follow fact wherever lead clinton running mate tim kaine picked news comey firing tuesday tweeting trump firing comey show frightened admin russia investigation,senate judiciary committee clarifying testimony relation hillary clinton email scandal fbi director james comey fired today president donald j trump informed fbi director james comey terminated removed office white house press secretary sean spicer said statement president trump acted based clear recommendation deputy attorney general rod rosenstein attorney general jeff session trump letter terminating comey quickly leaked online greatly appreciate informing three separate occasion investigation nonetheless concur judgment department justice
2565,"The White House says that President Trump fired James Comey on Tuesday because he received a brief letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling for the FBI director’s dismissal. That letter relies on a longer memo in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommends that Comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal during the campaign. A White House spokesman told Politico that Trump did not request the letters, and had no idea that they were coming.

As New York contributor Roger Parloff notes, this memo might have made sense if it was issued on day one of the Trump administration. “But for it to suddenly come out on May 9, 2017, after the nation has watched and listened to Trump warmly defend and commend Comey’s conduct in countless tweets and interviews, renders its content simply incredible.”

Plus, the president’s short letter to Comey says nothing about the Clinton probe, but references the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible Russia ties, saying, “I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.”

Sure enough, several outlets reported early on Wednesday morning that Comey’s dismissal was actually about Trump’s anger over the FBI’s Russia probe and Comey’s media appearances. The president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week — and maybe much longer. It appears this moment from January 22, when Trump greeted Comey by blowing him a kiss and commenting “Oh, and there’s James — he’s become more famous than me,” was a sign that Comey’s days as director were numbered.

According to The Wall Street Journal, in recent months Trump became irritated that Comey was receiving more media attention, and wasn’t using his newfound fame to quash the rumors about Trump’s Russia ties:

The more James Comey showed up on television discussing the FBI’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the more the White House bristled, according to aides to President Donald Trump.

Frustration was growing among top associates of the president that Mr. Comey, in a series of appearances before a Senate panel, wouldn’t publicly tamp down questions about possible collusion with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. A person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted Mr. Comey to “say those three little words: ‘There’s no ties.’”
Politico reports that Trump was particularly angry about Comey confirming to the Senate in March that the FBI had been investigating his campaign since last summer, and the director’s refusal to back up his claim that President Obama wiretapped him. He’d even taken to shouting at his TV over the Russia investigation:

He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.
Only a handful of top advisers, including Sessions and Rosenstein, knew Trump was planning to fire Comey. According to CNN, the pair started fine-tuning their rationale for firing Comey after they learned Trump wanted him gone.

It appears those in the know seriously underestimated the ramifications of the president dismissing the official leading an investigation into his campaign. Sources told Politico that the White House thought Comey’s firing would be “win-win,” since he’d been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. Trump called several senators to inform them of his decision on Monday evening, and was reportedly “taken aback” when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told him he was making a huge mistake.

Nevertheless, Trump’s security aide Keith Schiller was sent to personally deliver Comey’s dismissal letter to FBI headquarters. Apparently the White House was unaware that Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

Like Comey himself, many top White House officials only learned what had happened from media reports. Yet Trump was reportedly annoyed that his staff was caught off guard:

One source familiar with the President’s reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.
While Trump is known to put a lot of stock in how things play on cable news, in general the White House doesn’t seem all that concerned about the optics of the situation. Hours after the news broke, the White House announced that Trump will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, and a Justice Department official suggested that there could be more firings.

2566,"With an unanticipated coup de théâtre, Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey yesterday (May 9). Comey learned of his dismissal from cable news reports while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the FBI. It was so unexpected that the former FBI director apparently thought it was a joke.
According to the official version of what transpired, the Trump administration decided to fire Comey in large part because of his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. But the fact that Comey was in charge of investigating potential ties between the Trump administration and Russia seems too coincidental to overlook. Many pundits have also pointed out the parallels between Trump’s decision and president Richard Nixon’s notorious Saturday Night Massacre, when Nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.
Trump’s administration has already weathered its fair share of scandals. The maelstrom of media coverage and the confusing and contradictory explanations offered by Trump aides can make it difficult to discern which stories are actually problematic and which are more smoke than fire.
So how big a deal is Comey’s firing? To gauge this we first need to know the real reasons motivating Trump and his attorney general. With the administration sticking to its story—for now—here is a ranking of possible scenarios:
Trump fired Comey because his mistakes made the FBI look bad

Ranking: Easy D
On May 8, Comey testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee. During this appearance, he said that HillaryClinton’s top aide Huma Habedin had forwarded “hundreds and thousands” of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner, some of which were classified—so that Weiner could print them out. That claim turned out to be incorrect. According to the White House, it was also the last straw: Comey had mishandled the Clinton investigation since the very beginning, the administration used this last mistake as a reason to finally pull the plug on him.
If plain incompetence is indeed the real reason behind Comey’s firing, it would represent the least concerning scenario. As Quartz has already pointed out, the decision could have been managed more elegantly and the timing is bizarre as most of Comey’s alleged mistakes happened months ago. Then again, delayed firings are one of Trump’s specialities.
The silver lining? If Trump is truly committed to investigating Russia’s alleged meddling—and this is a huge hypothetical if—he may be more likely to appoint an independent special prosecutor to pick up Comey’s investigation.
Trump fired Comey because he wouldn’t investigate wiretapping at Trump Tower

Ranking: Sad!
Trump is a master conspiracy theorist, especially when it comes to the circumstances of his own election. Whether claiming Clinton benefited from millions of illegal votes or arguing with the National Parks Service over the crowd at his inauguration, Trump, by his own admission, believes the truth is not absolute.
One of Trump’s strongly held opinions is the unproven claim that president Obama tapped his phones during the campaign. Relatedly, it’s possible that when Comey refused to substantiate the conspiracy, the president grew increasingly frustrated and eventually decided to cook up an excuse to get rid of the FBI director. Comey’s bungled testimony regarding the Clinton emails represented the perfect opportunity.
A vindictive president who believes in alternative facts and doesn’t like being questioned is an unpredictable president. Partisanship is bad enough—presidents should not allow their personal biases to dictate policy and professional duties.
Trump fired Comey because of the Russia investigation

Ranking: Total disaster!
But what if Trump was truly attempting to use his executive powers to halt an investigation and potentially enable a cover-up? This is the worst case scenario.
Comey was reportedly expanding the investigation into Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. In this last and most troubling scenario, Trump, eager to hinder the FBI’s search—or simply wishing to avoid a prolonged PR disaster—instructed his staff to find an excuse, no matter how old, to cut the head off the proverbial snake.
Attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had publicly recused himself from the Russia investigation, was involved in the decision of removing Comey and will be involved in choosing the next FBI director. If impeding the FBI’s investigation really was the objective, Trump will now be able to select a prosecutor friendly to the White House. Whoever is selected will also have their predecessor’s fate as a reminder of what happens to directors who dare challenge the president. In such a scenario, it is also unlikely the attorney general (who helped him get rid of Comey) would appoint a special prosecutor.",unanticipated coup de th tre donald trump fired fbi director james comey yesterday may comey learned dismissal cable news report event talent acquisition diversity fbi unexpected former fbi director apparently thought joke according official version transpired trump administration decided fire comey large part handling investigation hillary clinton email fact comey charge investigating potential tie trump administration russia seems coincidental overlook many pundit also pointed parallel trump decision president richard nixon notorious saturday night massacre nixon fired special prosecutor investigating watergate scandal trump administration already weathered fair share scandal maelstrom medium coverage confusing contradictory explanation offered trump aide make difficult discern story actually problematic smoke fire big deal comey firing gauge first need know real reason motivating trump attorney general administration sticking story ranking possible scenario trump fired comey mistake made fbi look bad ranking easy may comey testified front senate judiciary committee appearance said hillaryclinton top aide huma habedin forwarded hundred thousand email husband anthony weiner classified weiner could print claim turned incorrect according white house also last straw comey mishandled clinton investigation since beginning administration used last mistake reason finally pull plug plain incompetence indeed real reason behind comey firing would represent least concerning scenario quartz already pointed decision could managed elegantly timing bizarre comey alleged mistake happened month ago delayed firing one trump speciality silver lining trump truly committed investigating russia alleged meddling huge hypothetical may likely appoint independent special prosecutor pick comey investigation trump fired comey investigate wiretapping trump tower ranking sad trump master conspiracy theorist especially come circumstance election whether claiming clinton benefited million illegal vote arguing national park service crowd inauguration trump admission belief truth absolute one trump strongly held opinion unproven claim president obama tapped phone campaign relatedly possible comey refused substantiate conspiracy president grew increasingly frustrated eventually decided cook excuse get rid fbi director comey bungled testimony regarding clinton email represented perfect opportunity vindictive president belief alternative fact like questioned unpredictable president partisanship bad enough president allow personal bias dictate policy professional duty trump fired comey russia investigation ranking total disaster trump truly attempting use executive power halt investigation potentially enable cover worst case scenario comey reportedly expanding investigation russia alleged involvement presidential election last troubling scenario trump eager hinder fbi search simply wishing avoid prolonged pr disaster instructed staff find excuse matter old cut head proverbial snake attorney general jeff session publicly recused russia investigation involved decision removing comey involved choosing next fbi director impeding fbi investigation really objective trump able select prosecutor friendly white house whoever selected also predecessor fate reminder happens director dare challenge president scenario also unlikely attorney general helped get rid comey would appoint special prosecutor,coup de th tre donald trump fired fbi director james comey yesterday may comey learned dismissal cable news report event talent acquisition diversity fbi unexpected former fbi director apparently thought joke according official version transpired trump administration decided fire comey large part handling investigation hillary clinton email fact comey charge investigating potential tie trump administration russia seems coincidental overlook many pundit also pointed parallel trump decision president richard nixon notorious
2567,"Donald Trump has said he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he decided James Comey’s fate – contradicting the White House rationale that he fired the FBI director for mishandling the Clinton email investigation.

Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president. Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: “And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.’”

Trump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation. The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia.

In the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general.

Trump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last year’s presidential election. First, he said, there was a dinner which was also about Comey’s future, raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job.

“He wanted to stay on at the FBI,” Trump said, “and I said I’ll, you know, consider and see what happens … But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me, ‘You are not under investigation.’’’

Acting FBI director refutes claims that staff lost faith in Comey
Then there were two phone calls, one made by Trump, another by Comey. The president admitted: “I actually asked him, yes. I said, ‘If it’s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said: ‘You are not under investigation.’”

The revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism. Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal. Meanwhile, Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal, but highly irregular. On Thursday, Trump’s words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynch’s controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June, during the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Department of Justice, told MSNBC: “It’s completely inappropriate for [Trump] to ask that question … It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it.”

Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: “No, I don’t believe it is.”

She added: “I don’t see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who’ve been commenting on it over the last hour.” Sanders did not identify which “legal scholars” that she was referring to.

When the president fired Comey on Tuesday, the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey, a position backed by vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday.

Pence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had “made a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey.”

But in the NBC interview, Trump said of Comey: “He’s a showboat, he’s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn’t recovered from that.”

He explained: “I was going to fire Comey. My decision. I was going to fire Comey. There’s no good time to do it, by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.”

The revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile, his failure to stop leaks, his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the president’s claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama.

In the end, he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon, a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise. The official reason given was the FBI director’s mishandling of the investigation into Clinton’s emails.

The acting head of the FBI, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff – directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file.

Confronted at a Senate intelligence committee hearing with the claim of Comey’s unpopularity, Andrew McCabe said: “That is not accurate.”

“I can tell you I worked very, very closely [with Comey] from the time we started at the Washington field office,” he said. “I hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity. It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him. He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day … the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.”

In contrast, Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with “countless” FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision. She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents.

Earlier on Thursday, Sanders told CBS News Trump was “very likely” to visit FBI headquarters “in the next few days”. But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly.

Making his first public appearance since Comey’s dismissal, McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump’s associates and Russia during last year’s election. He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up.

Asked by Senator Marco Rubio if Comey’s abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the FBI, McCabe was adamant.

“You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution,” he said. Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued “vigorously and completely”.

To reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation, McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed.

Opening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies, the committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, said it would not be solely focused on the Trump-Russia enquiry. However, Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue.

“It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today,” said the top Democrat on the committee, Mark Warner. “The president’s firing of FBI director Comey … was a shocking development.

“The timing of Director Comey’s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling. He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts to interfere in our election.
“For many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president’s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable.”

It emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the president’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, requesting “documents relevant to the committee’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election”.

Comey – who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles – sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday.

“It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,” he wrote. “My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the constitution.”",donald trump said thinking russia thing decided james comey fate contradicting white house rationale fired fbi director mishandling clinton email investigation

2568,"As genetically modified (GM) foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding GM food safety. These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems. The review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each GM food, but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings. The results of most studies with GM foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters. However, many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment. The use of recombinant GH or its expression in animals should be re-examined since it has been shown that it increases IGF-1 which may promote cancer.",genetically modified gm food starting intrude diet concern expressed regarding gm food safety concern well limitation procedure followed evaluation safety presented animal toxicity study certain gm food shown may toxically affect several organ system review study conducted separately gm food according effect exerted certain organ may help u create better picture possible health effect human being result study gm food indicate may cause common toxic effect hepatic pancreatic renal reproductive effect may alter hematological biochemical immunologic parameter however many year research animal clinical trial required assessment use recombinant gh expression animal examined since shown increase igf may promote cancer,gm food starting intrude diet concern expressed regarding gm food safety concern well limitation procedure followed evaluation safety presented animal toxicity study certain gm food shown may toxically affect several organ system review study conducted separately gm food according effect exerted certain organ may help u create better picture possible health effect human being result study gm food indicate may cause common toxic effect hepatic pancreatic renal reproductive effect may alter hematological biochemical immunologic parameter however many year research animal clinical trial required assessment use
2569,"You don't have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves: More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered (to increase yields), and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods, from soda to salad dressing to bread. Advocates say genetically modified (GM) foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicals—which means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all. But the question remains: What impact do GM foods have on our health?

The answer is, no one really knows. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994, and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce. To date most of the studies have been done on animals; worryingly, though, some of those studies link GM foods to altered metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver malfunction, and reduced fertility. In one experiment, multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of GM soy; by the third generation, they were losing the ability to produce offspring, producing about half as many pups as the non-GM soy group.

In addition, allergy sufferers worry that, as genes are transferred between plants, allergenic proteins (from, say, peanuts or wheat) will pop up in unexpected places (like soy or sugar). Richard Goodman, PhD, a professor of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a former scientist for Monsanto, says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening. But inserting new genes into a seed's delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists can't predict all the consequences. There is, for example, the possibility of creating brand-new allergens.

Despite the potential health implications, more GM foods appear each year. In 2011 the USDA approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets (sucrose) and alfalfa (hay for livestock). The FDA is expected to okay a fast-growing salmon in the near future. And possibly on the horizon: pigs designed to produce omega-3s.

Yet because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such, it's impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods. Gary Hirshberg, chairman and cofounder of Stonyfield, the organic yogurt company, thinks that's not right. Last October he partnered with Just Label It, a national coalition of nearly 450 organizations that's currently petitioning the FDA to give consumers a choice. More than 600,000 people have already signed. (To add your name, go to justlabelit.org.)

""The status quo is innocent until proven guilty,"" says Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian who studies GM foods, ""as it was for trans fats, DDT, and countless other harmful chemicals. A labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe, to protect their sales."" Nearly 50 other countries—including China, Brazil, and most European nations—have mandated that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) be marked, and in an MSNBC online poll, 96 percent of more than 45,000 respondents said that they should be labeled. At press time, 18 states had introduced legislation to promote GMO labeling.

Hirshberg, for one, remains impatient. ""I'm 57,"" he says. ""I don't want to wait another 30 years to see what the science says. At this point, I want to decide for myself.""

2570,"Over the past few years, a number of countries have completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go along with them, and they are doing so for a reason. The latest country to consider a complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10 year ban.

The truth is, we don’t know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption. Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless.

There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed, and more are emerging every year.  There are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them.

By slipping it into our food without our knowledge, without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food, we are now unwittingly part of a massive experiment.The FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food, so they’ll be treated in the same way. The problem is this, geneticists follow the inheritance of genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism, and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species. Now David Suzuki doesn’t normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints. It’s very very bad science, we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically, applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally. There’s absolutely no reason to make that conclusion – Geneticist David Suzuki

If anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that GMOs are totally safe to eat, they haven’t done their research. There is no reason GM foods should be approved safe for consumption, we just don’t know enough about them. We could easily feed the planet through organic, GMO free methods, there is absolutely no reason we need GM foods around.

Below I’ve presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research if you’re interested.

1. Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood

Research from Canada (the first of its kind) has successfully identified the presence of pesticides -associated with genetically modified foods in maternal, fetal and non-pregnant women’s blood. They also found the presence of Monsanto’s Bt toxin. The study was published in the Journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011.(1) You can read the FULL study here.

“Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly those using the placental transfer approach. Thus, our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition, toxicology and reproduction in women. Today, obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known.  Thus, knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area.” (1)

The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.)  This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.

2. DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them

In a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS), researchersemphasize that there is sufficient evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments carry complete genes that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism.(2)

In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA.  The study was based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies. PLOS is an open access, well respected peer-reviewed scientific journal that covers primary research from disciplines within science and medicine. It’s great to see this study published in it, confirming what many have been suspected for years.

“Our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system. Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the plasma samples while non-plasma (cord blood) control sample was found to be free of plant DNA.” (2)

This still doesn’t mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, but given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer (later in this article) it is safe to assume it is indeed a possibility. The bottom line is that we don’t know, and this study demonstrates another cause for concern.

3. New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans

This study was recently released by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), and uses data from the US department of Agriculture, US Environmental Protection Agency, medical journal reviews as well as other independent research. (3)(4) The authors relate GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten-related disorders, including the autoimmune disorder, Celiac Disease:

Intestinal permeability
Imbalanced gut bacteria
Immune activation and allergic response
Impaired digestion
Damage to the intestinal wall
The Institute for Responsible technology is a world leader in educating policy makers and the public about GMO foods and crops. The institute reports and investigates on the impact GM foods can have on health, environment, agriculture and more.

4. Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors

In November 2012, The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper titled ‘Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize’ by Gilles-Eric Seralini and his team of researchers at France’s Caen University. (5)

It was a very significant study, which obviously looks bad for the big bio tech companies like Monsanto, being the first and only long term study under controlled conditions examining the possible effects of a diet of GMO maize treated with Monsanto roundup herbicide.

This study has since been retracted, which is odd, because the journal it was published in is a very well known, reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. In order for a study to be published here it has to go through a rigorous review process.

It’s also important to note that hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction of the study. This study was done by experts, and a correlation between GMOs and these tumors can’t be denied, something happened.

The multiple criticisms of the study have also been answered by the team of researchers that conducted the study. You can read them and find out more about the study here.

GM Crop Production is Lowering US Yields and Increasing Pesticide Use

5. Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors

A study is published in the US National Library of Medicine (4) and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. Several recent studies showed glyphosate’s potential to be an endocrine disruptor. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals. These disruptors can cause developmental disorders, birth defects and cancer tumors. (6)

Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer. We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity. (6)

Researchers also determined that Monsanto’s roundup is considered an “xenoestrogen,” which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies. This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers, early onset of puberty, thyroid issues, infertility and more.

6. Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects

A group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsanto’s glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002. Regulators misled the public about glyphosate’s safety, and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects. (7)

Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable. In this report, we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate. We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate’s teratogenicity in industry’s own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission’s final review report (7)

Here is a summary of the report:

Multiple peer-reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate
Industry (including Monsanto) has known since the 1980?s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses
Industry has known since 1993 that these effects could also occur at lower and mid doses
The German government has known since at least 1998 that glyphosate causes malformations
The EU Commission’s expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations
The EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations. This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report, laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate
Another study published by the American Chemical Society, from the university of Buenos Aires, Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities.(8)

The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to glyphosate in agricultural fields (8)

7. Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

When you ingest Glyphosate, you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body. It’s completely unnatural and the body doesn’t resonate with it. P450 (CYP) is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate. P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells, as well as breaking them down. CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions. They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body, things like the various chemicals found in pesticides, drugs and carcinogens. Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes. The CYP pathway is critical for normal, natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies. Because humans that’ve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels, they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with weight gain, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. (9)

8. Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans

A new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine. It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations. (10)

To this day, Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin. Environmentalists, veterinarians, medical doctors and scientists however, have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment. The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern. In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany, especially cattle, glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine, feces, milk and feed of the animals.

9. Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs

A study by scientist Judy Carman, PhD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health. (11) Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs.

The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren’t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States.

10. GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. (12)(13)(14)

Deficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods.

The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. However, they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment. Additionally, the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAO/WHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence, considering parameters such as molecular characterization, phenotypic characteristics, key nutrients, toxicants and allergens. Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO. Published reviews with around 25 peer-reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines, the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype.(12) (15)

“The risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic. Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods, animal models and parameters. The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals. However, adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported. While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods, attempts towards harmonization are on the way. More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods.” (12) (15)

So, if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption, it’s not true. We just don’t know enough about them to make such a definitive statement. A lot of evidence actually points to the contrary.

2571,"Activists often cite the alleged potential health risks of genetically modified foods. One recent example of this—”10 Scientific Studies Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health“, posted on Collective-Evolution.com—outlines many familiar concerns and points in each case to “credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed”.

Are these concerns credible? What do the studies cited actually claim?

1) Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood.

The blog post sites a 2010 study that alleges to show this danger. The authors identified the Bt protein Cry1Ab in maternal and fetal blood, a protein found in some GMOs, but also commonly used as a pesticide in organic farming. The paper is flawed. The researchers’ measurements were based on an experiment/assay designed to detect Bt’s Cry1Ab in plants, not in humans. As this post in Biofortified.org explains, the pregnant women in the study would have had to eat several kilos of corn in order to get the Bt measurements that were detected in their blood.

Additionally, there’s the “so what” factor. Humans lack the receptors for the protein, so it has no impact on us. Did you know that chocolate is toxic to dogs? Are you concerned that it might be toxic to you? Probably not (if you are concerned, then you’ve missed out on the greatest source of joy known to human taste buds…). Some chemical compounds behave differently among species, and both Bt‘s Cry1Ab and chocolate are examples of this.

2) DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them

That’s not what the cited 2013 study concluded. The authors found that whole genes from our food can be detected in our plasma. That does not mean that they’ve integrated into our DNA; it means that they’ve been found floating in the space between cells. And that’s any food, not just GMOs. DNA from GMOs behave no differently than DNA from organic or conventional foods

If you aren’t concerned about the DNA from blueberries “transferring” into you, then you should not be concerned about DNA from GMOs either. The paper’s deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments. Several recent papers (see here and here) have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little DNA to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents. (For a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing, see here).

3) New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans

The article quotes for an alleged “study” by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT). But there is no study on the link of GMOs to gluten allergies. There’s a link to a post on a webpage, but there isn’t a peer-reviewed article. IRT is a one-man band run by activist Jeffrey Smith. It is an NGO that advocates for the elimination of GMOs from our food supply. It’s not a university, college or research institution. It doesn’t do studies.

I’ve written about gluten allergies and GMOs. The Celiac Disease foundation has spoken out against the IRT’s report. GMO wheat has not been commercialized, so any association of gluten allergies with the consumption of GMO wheat is on its face absurd. As for charts that track an increase in GMO consumption in general and gluten allergies, it’s a case of association with no causation (i.e. the incidence of gluten allergies have increased over the past decade and the amount of GMOs we eat have increased too. But, so have the number of plasma screens manufactured).

4) Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors

This claim is the infamous Seralini paper, which was retracted, and recently republished, in a different journal without being peer reviewed. The paper identified tumors in rats that were fed GMOs and/or the herbicide glyphosate longterm. But the strain of rat used was predisposed to tumors. The paper did not perform statistical analyses and used too few rats, so it was not possible to determine if the tumors were due to the food, the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rats would get tumors regardless of what they were fed. Finally, the findings from Seralini’s paper are contrary to other long-term feeding studies. An overview of the criticisms regarding this paper can be found here.

5) Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors

This claim relates to glyphosate, an herbicide used in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modified crops. The cited paper examines the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth. In approximately 80 percent of instances of breast cancer, the diseased cells are hormone sensitive, meaning they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread. These researchers took two breast cancer cell lines: one was estrogen sensitive and one was not, and they examined the impact of increasing amounts of glyphosate on cell growth. They found that glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen, although the relationship was not as strong, and it did not have an impact on the proliferation of the non-hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line.

The paper had numerous technical problems, including the absence of data on controls, a potentially critical omission. Additionally, there actually seems to be a protective effect at higher concentrations of glyphosate: instead of reaching a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer has an effect on cell growth, there is no significant difference in cellular growth between the cells that received the highest doses of glyphosate and the controls  (which is why the data from the controls is an important factor).

This experiment was done with cells in a petri dish—what’s called an in vitro tissue-culture experiment. Such research is of limited real-world value. The cells are often finicky and need plenty of TLC in order to grow well; different cell lines can also behave very differently. The authors of the paper note some of these issues, along with the fact that their data doesn’t mesh with previous studies that have examined the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation (this previous paper suggests that glyphosate actually protects against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell lines and that glyphosate might be developed into an anti-cancer drug!).

Monsanto wrote a response to the paper noting that many studies examined the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none has found that the compound causes cancer. Some news reports misinterpreted the study, writing that researchers concluded that glyphosate causes cancer when that is not the researchers’ findings: they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate. Monsanto pointed out that even this finding is contrary to the body of evidence that exists on the topic. The authors admit to this fact and discuss the appropriate next steps to examine this issue in mice/rats models for breast cancer. I think that that’s a great next step. I’d also look at a few more breast-cancer cell lines.

This is the most compelling research paper that I’ve read about that suggests a potential health risk surrounding glyphosate. But the study must be reproduced and its issues ironed out. However, as I mentioned, the paper isn’t really about GMOs as a class: keep in mind that only a fraction of GMOs are glyphosate resistant (i.e. Round-up Ready crops) and the use of glyphosate is not limited to GMOs.

Additionally, the paper does several experiments with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth is very similar to that of glyphosate’s—meaning that there are “natural” compounds in our food that seem to have the same impact on breast-cancer proliferation that this paper’s findings suggest for glyphosate. There does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients, although several publications have examined this issue without finding a positive correlation (examples here, here, and here).

6) Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects

No peer reviewed, published scientific study makes such claims. The source of this health concern is a publication by Earth Open Source, an anti-GMO NGO co-founded by an individual who also owns a GMO-testing and certification company, and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of anti-GMO sentiments (see “About the Authors” in this document).

7) Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

The paper that led to this health claim does not constitute research. It’s a hypothesis and no research was done to support the hypothesis. The paper was reviewed by science journalist Keith Kloor at Discover Magazine who aptly compared it to a Glenn Beck chalkboard drawing.

The claims were printed in a pay-for-play journal (also known as predatory journal), meaning that for a fee, one can get nearly anything published. There have been several exposés on pay-for-play journals, and many scientists believe that the phenomenon is eroding the quality of science (here’s an overview from Nature.com; here’s an exposé of pay for play journals)

8) Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans

This claim is based on a paper published in the Journal of Environmental and Analytical Toxicology, owned by the Omics publishing group- a notorious predatory publishing company.

The authors examined glyphosate levels in humans and different animals. There’s no indication of what the animals were fed, how much, how they were kept or myriad other variables. Any of these could invalidate the study. The researchers do not say anything about the age, sex, weight, height, or genetic background of the humans, or how much they ate, if they washed their food, how long they had been eating organic/conventional diets and, most mind-blowing of all, there’s absolutely no definition for what constitutes being “chronically ill”. Any single issue that I’ve listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal.

9) Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs

In the study on which this claim is based, the researchers gave pigs GMO feed and non-GMO feed and identified the differences between the two groups. The paper has been thoroughly challenged by many journalists and scientists:

Journalist Mark Lynas highlighted the degree to which the data is cherry-picked. The difference in “inflammation” between the GM-fed and non-GM-fed pigs is apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories, but there’s no difference if you view it as a single category. Overall, there’s a high rate of inflammation for both groups, which is not explained in the paper. At the same time, there are several parameters where GM-feed could be argued as having a protective effect (there are 50 percent fewer heart-abnormalities in pigs fed GM-grain), but this isn’t discussed.
As explained by geneticist Anastasia Bodnar, the authors do not analyze the compositional differences in the feed between the two groups. Previous studies have determined that the environment (i.e., water, soil, geography) of a crop has a greater impact on proteins and metabolites than whether or not the crop is a GMO. As such, the differences seen in the pigs may not be due pesticides or presence/absence of the transgenic protein; rather, they are most likely due to differences in composition of the feed
Geneticist Val Giddings notes that the animals had abnormally high rates of pneumonia, which points to the possibility that something wonky was going on.
In conclusion, even if the paper’s findings are real, there’s no knowing whether that’s due to something associated with transgenes or not, because the researchers do not account for natural variation in the feed.

10) GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety.

Let’s set aside the fact that this isn’t a “Scientific Study Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health,” which is the claim set out in the title. There are three papers associated with this bullet point. The first one is a review and I agree with a few of the points it makes. It highlights the need for standardized tests and statistics in animal feeding studies for GMOs, and anyone who followed the Seralini debacle would probably agree. It summarizes papers that have performed feeding studies and their results. However, the review does not remove flawed papers from their overview and nor does it distinguish between feeding studies for GMO crops that have been commercialized vs. crops that have never been submitted for regulatory approval. The paper does not conclude, “GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence”.

The second paper is also a review piece. The first author is affiliated with “Friends of the Earth,” an anti-GMO NGO. It does not constitute novel research and has a clear editorial slant.

The third paper does not even qualify as a review. It’s a commentary published in 2002 in Nature Biotechnology, which is a high caliber journal. It outlined possible unintended consequences that could happen with a GMO—none of which have ever been documented or identified since then, to the best of my knowledge.

In conclusion, despite the title of the article, none of these studies proves or even persuasively suggests that GMOs can be harmful to human health. The majority are either obviously flawed or are not scientific studies.

The current scientific consensus regarding GMOs remains unchanged: they are safe and do not pose a health risk to humans. However, a scientific consensus is subject to change if there is sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it, but none of the studies reviewed here constitute such evidence.",activist often

2572,"It’s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks.

Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016.

Seth Rich, who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery.

WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder.

The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right.

But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source.

Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

""We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,"" Gingrich said on Fox May 21. ""Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians.""

Contrary to Gingrich’s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory.

Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails
The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15.

Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation.

Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC.

""But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?"" asked the WTTG-TV reporter.

""Absolutely,"" Wheeler replied. ""Yeah, and that’s confirmed.""

The next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler’s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich’s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders.

Here’s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn’t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich’s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work.

""Let me just really quickly say this,"" Wheeler said on Hannity’s show May 16. ""I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way.""

Fox retracted its own May 16 article, saying ""the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.""

So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case.

The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity.

All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit.

Lots of evidence Russia stole, then leaked, the emails
The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints.

The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations.

There’s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example.

Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russia’s culpability in official reports in October, December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since.

""The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked,"" said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing. ""The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years.""

There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack.

""The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. ""Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data.""

Our ruling
Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich ""apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians.""

There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination.

The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work.

2573,"On 16 May 2017, Fox News published an explosive report linking the death of murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich to tens of thousands of e-mails allegedly found on his laptop computer. Fox reported that the e-mails were internal Democratic National Committee messages Rich transferred to Gavin McFayden, a now-deceased investigative journalist, who then sent them to the document-dumping web site WikiLeaks.

The Fox report claimed that there was a conspiracy between the local police department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the D.C. mayor’s office to cover up the investigation:

An FBI forensic report of Rich’s computer — generated within 96 hours after Rich’s murder — showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.

“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.

The revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich’s family to probe the case.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”

The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.
Rich, a 27-year-old DNC staffer, was shot twice in the back at 4:20 in the morning on 10 July 2016 amid the run-up to the presidential election. Although none of his possessions were taken from him, Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police consider it a botched robbery attempt, because there had been a spate of muggings in Rich’s Bloomingdale neighborhood at the time.

Almost two weeks later, on 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks dumped a load of hacked e-mails that would embarrass the DNC and create a media frenzy in the months before the election. The timing of the incidents, as well as Rich’s employment at the DNC, led to conspiracy theories tying his death to the leak. Adding to the confusion, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer. Since his death, Rich’s family has consistently denied rumors linking him to WikiLeaks.

The Fox News story about Rich came one day after a report by the Washington Post accused President Donald Trump of spilling classified information to Russian envoys during their visit to the Oval Office on 10 May 2017. Brad Bauman, a spokesperson for Rich’s family, told us he believed the Fox story was motivated by a desire to deflect attention away from the Post report:

I think there’s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.
The Fox story uses two sources: Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor characterized as a private investigator in the article, and an unnamed “federal investigator.” On 15 May 2017, Wheeler speculated to local news outlet Fox5 that there was critical information on a computer that belonged to him, which was either in the possession of the FBI or MPD:

The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming. They haven’t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer which I believe is either at the police department or at the FBI. I’ve been told both.
Wheeler claimed to have a source at the FBI that “confirmed” Rich was linked to WikiLeaks, and a source inside the police department who told him MPD was told to “stand down” from the investigation. In a follow-up interview on Fox News, Wheeler implied that a conspiracy reaching to the highest levels of the city’s government was at work:

I want to find out who caused that man’s death so we can put them behind bars. But if there’s somebody in politics, if there’s somebody in government, whether it’s the mayor’s office or anywhere else in this city that’s involved, you better believe they’re going to be dragged in and questioned.
We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich’s murder — it is an MPD investigation.

We reached out to Wheeler by e-mail and have yet to receive a response, but since the Fox story was published, he has been quoted in several news articles recanting his original story. He told BuzzFeed News the following day, “That story on Fox 5 last night was inaccurate. I don’t even know where the computers are.”

On 19 May 2017, the Rich family attorney sent Wheeler a cease and desist letter saying he had violated a contract forbidding him to publicly disclose information about the case and threatening to sue if he continues to do so.

We contacted the office of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to ask if there was a lurid connection between the mayor, the DNC, and Rich’s death, and got a flat denial from spokesman Kevin Harris:

All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case.
We also asked the police department about Wheeler’s claims that the department was stepping back from the investigation. A spokesperson for the department denied it and said that the investigation remains active:

The assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded. The Metropolitan Police Department’s (MPD) Homicide Branch is actively investigating Mr. Rich’s murder  and we continue to work with the family to bring closure to this case as we do with all homicide investigations. If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at 202-727-9099 or text us at 50411.  The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.
Bauman said in a statement that Wheeler was not authorized to speak on behalf of the family, and added the family only learned of the new round of accusations through news reports:

Even if tomorrow, an e-mail was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions, as e-mails can be altered and we’ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth’s murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family, unless explicitly authorized by the family.
McFayden, an investigative journalist who was an early defender of WikiLeaks, died in October 2016 after a battle with lung cancer.

Although the Fox report claims Wheeler is a private investigator, a search for Wheeler’s name on the public lookup tool for licenses in Washington D.C. yields no results. We also checked for a license under his name in Maryland, where his firm Capitol Investigations is based. This search also yielded no results. When we asked MPD whether he was indeed a homicide detective with the department, they only confirmed he once worked there starting in 1990. He was dismissed by the department in 1995, but a spokesman did not explain why.

We sent an e-mail to Wheeler through his firm and have not yet received a response.

NBC News identified the “third party” who hired Wheeler to investigate Rich’s murder as Ed Butowsky, a Dallas-based financial adviser, who is also a Fox News contributor.",may fox news published

2574,"“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.”
- Rod Wheeler, former DC homicide investigator

Wheeler made his comments on the possible Rich-Wikileaks connection in a story first reported Monday night by Fox 5 DC.

In an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Tuesday night, Wheeler said a ""federal investigator that was involved on the inside of the case"" saw Rich's computer and the case file.

Wheeler told host Sean Hannity the investigator ""came across [as] very credible. When you look at that, with the totality of everything else that I found in this case, it’s very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think, 'Well, perhaps there were some email communication between Seth and Wikileaks.'""

But a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks ""unsubstantiated."" Brad Bauman said even if purported emails were to surface, it would not necessarily mean Rich had helped WikiLeaks.

""Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so,"" Bauman said. ""We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.""

Although Bauman said Wheeler was paid by a third party, the family is named as clients of Wheeler's Capitol Investigations on a contract signed by Rich's father, Joel Rich.

The family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved. Wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims.

An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.

“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.

The revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich’s family to probe the case.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”

The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.

On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party’s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.

WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the source of the emails, but has taken a keen interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.

“WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich,” the organization announced.

Assange has not returned a series of recent emails from Fox News about Rich. MacFadyen, who was considered a mentor by Assange, died of lung cancer on Oct. 22 at age 76.

Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department has no suspects and no substantial leads as to who the killer or killers may be, sources close to the investigation said. Metropolitan Police, including the police chief, have refused to discuss the case, despite requests from Fox News dating back 10 months.

The department released a statement on the case saying it remains an active investigation and that detectives are working with Rich's family.

""If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at (202) 727-9099 or text us at 50411,"" read the statement. ""The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.""

The FBI’s national office declined to comment, but sources said the bureau provided cyber expertise to examine Rich’s computer.

2575,"The life of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer, ended nearly a year ago when he was shot to death near his house in Washington, DC. Then came the tragic and bizarre afterlife: Since July, Rich has been the focus of intense right-wing conspiracy theories that have only escalated as the Trump administration’s scandals have deepened.

As the police have repeatedly stated, there is no evidence that Rich’s death was anything other than the consequence of a botched robbery. But some people, especially on the right, believe Rich was murdered by the Clintons for knowing too much about something. The most recent theories claim that Rich, not the Russians, was responsible for leaking the emails, published in WikiLeaks, that revealed Democratic party leaders had talked disparagingly about Bernie Sanders.

Thanks to an erroneous Fox News story last week, which was finally retracted on Tuesday, Rich recently became the focus of an intense media blitz from conservative outlets — many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around Donald Trump.

Fox News’s Sean Hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers, devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to Rich. Even after Fox News retracted its story, Hannity promised he would continue to investigate. “I retracted nothing,” he said defiantly on his radio show Tuesday.

Rich’s family has been begging right-wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him, but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control.

In death, Rich has become a martyr to the right, buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives: There is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who wants to downplay the connections between WikiLeaks and the Russians; there are the Clinton haters, who want to spread the idea that the Clintons are murderers; there are the Trump supporters, who want to minimize the idea that Russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate; and there are the talking heads on Fox News, who last week needed something other than negative Trump stories to make conversation about.

We might not know who killed Seth Rich, but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from, how it spreads, and the victims it creates.

Seth Rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence
Seth Rich worked in Democratic politics for most of his career. He grew up and went to college in Omaha, Nebraska, where as a student he volunteered on two Democratic Senate campaigns. After graduating, he moved to Washington, DC, for a job at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a progressive opinion research and consulting firm. He was later hired by the Democratic National Committee, where he worked on a project to help people find where to vote.

On Sunday, July 10, Rich was shot to death about a block from where he lived in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of DC. Gunshot detection microphones place the time of the shooting at around 4:20 am. Rich had last been seen at around 1:30 am leaving Lou’s City Bar in Columbia Heights, about a 40-minute walk from where he lived.

It is unclear exactly what happened during those three intervening hours. The Washington Post reported that, according to his parents, cellphone records show that Rich called his girlfriend at 2:05 am and talked to her for more than two hours. He hung up just minutes before he was shot.

The police found Rich on the sidewalk with multiple gunshot wounds, at least two in the back. He still had his watch, his cellphone, and his wallet. There were signs of a struggle: bruises on his hands, knees, and face, and a torn wristwatch strap. According to the police report, he was still “conscious and breathing.” Family members say they were told that Rich was “very talkative,” though it is not publicly known if he was able to describe his assailant or assailants. Rich died a few hours later in the hospital.

The police suspected Rich had been the victim of an attempted robbery. Bloomingdale is a gentrifying part of Washington that still suffers from violent crime. In 2016, there were 24 reported robberies with a gun that occurred within a quarter-mile of the street corner where Rich was shot.

The first conspiracy theories grew out of the “Clinton body count” rumor
Almost immediately after news of Rich’s death, conspiracy theories began circulating on social media. A few factors helped make Rich a target of speculation:

The murderers left behind Rich’s valuables. (Though, by that same paranoid logic, wouldn’t a professional hitman have taken Rich’s wallet and phone in order to make it look like a regular mugging?)
Rich worked at the DNC, where in December there had been a minor scandal involving a software glitch that allowed the Bernie Sanders campaign to access private voter data collected by the Clinton campaign.
Hillary Clinton had just clinched the nomination after a surprisingly bruising primary, and there were still sore feelings in the air.
There’s a long-running conspiracy theory that the Clintons have assassinated dozens of their political enemies.
If those facts don’t seem to add up to a coherent story, well, you’re thinking too hard. Conspiracy theories don’t operate logically. They start from an assumption — for instance, “the Clintons are shady” — and spiral outward in search of corroboration.

On Reddit, for instance, one user wrote a 1,400-word post listing things that he found “suspicious.” Here were some of the stray facts the redditor claimed were evidence of a hit job by the DNC or the Clintons:

Rich’s former employer, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, once did some consulting work for British Petroleum. (“Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public's disdain for oil industry/fracking?”)
Rich once worked on Ben Nelson’s campaign for senator. (“[Nelson] contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009.”)
The political conventions were coming up. (“The TIMING of this tragedy seems too 'coincidental’”)
It’s unclear what any of these facts have to do with the Clintons, but somehow the Reddit user concluded: “given his position & timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.”

Others on Twitter and the trolling website 4chan also speculated that Rich might have crossed the Clintons in some way. Rich’s death seemed to fit in with the “Clinton body count” theory, which dates to the 1990s and claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they don’t like.

People who believe the Clintons are murderers often point to deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, who suffered from clinical depression and died of a gunshot wound to the mouth in 1993. Several investigations all ruled Foster’s death a suicide, but some conservatives insisted there must have been foul play. They claimed that Foster, who was looking into the Clintons’ taxes, may have uncovered evidence of corruption in connection to the Whitewater controversy, a guilt-by-association scandal involving friends of the Clintons’.

The “Clinton body count” theory has endured over the years simply because people don’t live forever. Any time someone dies who was connected to the Clintons — and since Bill Clinton was the president of the United States, literally thousands of people were in his orbit — this theory is dredged up again by the tinfoil hat crowd. And then it slowly fades.

At first it seemed the speculation about Seth Rich would die down quickly as well. But then 12 days later, on July 22, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails from the DNC, and Rich became a politically useful distraction.

Julian Assange and WikiLeaks supercharged the Seth Rich rumors
A month before Rich was murdered, the DNC admitted that Russian hackers had broken into its computer network, gaining access to all of the DNC’s emails. The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich, according to one person “who was very close” to him, the Washington Post reported: “It was crazy. Especially for Seth. He said, ‘Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’ That made him so angry.”

When WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22, the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers. This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies, who concluded “with high confidence” that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers, who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks. “Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity,” the US intelligence report explained, as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today.

But WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency — as secretary of state, Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning.

On Dutch television in August 2016, Assange hinted that Rich, not Russia, may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails. ""Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks,” he said. “As a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.""


“Was he one of your sources then?” the anchor asked.

“We don’t comment on who our sources are,” Assange replied.

“Then why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?” the anchor replied.

Pressed repeatedly for clarification, Assange concluded that “others, others have suggested that. We’re investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich. I think it’s a concerning situation; there’s not a conclusion yet.”

As part of its “investigation,” WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize in August for information about Rich’s murder.

This is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage.

Trump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker, even though the facts didn’t really fit this pattern. He didn’t have access to the DNC emails, and he had never shown any prowess at hacking — being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills. Besides, the DNC wasn’t the only organization that was hacked: Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s personal emails, for instance, were stolen separately, as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Nevertheless, many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Rich’s murder. In August, former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Rich’s death was suspicious. “First of all, of course it’s worth talking about,” he said. “And if Assange says he is the source, Assange may know. That’s not complicated.”

That same month, Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed, without evidence, that Rich was murdered “on his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud.”

To Trump supporters, the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal: It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives, and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election — possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign.

In the presidential debate on September 26, Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails. ""It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,"" he said.

Thanks to a weird miscommunication, the conspiracy theory comes back in May
After the election, the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness, as the focus turned instead to the FBI’s investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents. Suspicions still bubbled in right-wing corners of Reddit and on alt-right websites like Gateway Pundit, and Assange continued to claim that it wasn’t the Russians who provided the hacked emails — but most of America had moved on.

But Rich returned to the news last week, when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler, who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks:

FOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...

WHEELER: For sure...

FOX 5 DC: ...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?

WHEELER: Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.
Conservative media outlets jumped on the story, which aired the night of Monday, May 15. By Tuesday morning, conservative outlets like Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheeler’s claims.

On Tuesday, Fox News added its own revelation: It claimed that an unnamed “federal investigator” had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. “I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,” the source said, according to Fox News. Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.

This was a two-source story: The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous “federal investigator” had told Fox News.

But here’s where it gets confusing. By Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken. It turns out he didn’t have any evidence of his own.

What had happened, apparently, was that earlier in the week, Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich. That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks. When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich, he believed he was giving viewers a “preview” of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday.

That, at least, is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday. Somehow, through miscommunication or sloppy reporting, the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich-WikiLeaks connection. This was incorrect, Wheeler said. He had no independent knowledge.

""I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,"" he told CNN.

Yesterday, after leaving it up for a week, Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source. “The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,” an editor’s note explained. “Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.”

Conservative media has a field day
It’s unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week.

Among other things, it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians, that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia, and that the Russia probe had reached a current high-level White House official, who many suspect is Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

One way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories. The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times.

For instance, while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians, the alt-right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy. Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich: “Silence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report” was the title of one story.

Fox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story, repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory. On his 10 pm show, Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday last week. “I'm not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich,” he said on Friday night.

On Tuesday, even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation, Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs. “I am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com,” he said on his radio show. “I retracted nothing.”

Later that evening, on his television show, Hannity said that for now, he would stop talking about Rich “out of respect for the family's wishes.” On Twitter, though, he was defiant, claiming that “liberal fascism” was trying to silence his voice.

“Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever,” he tweeted. “Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder.”

“Please retweet,” he added.

Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media
The recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories, bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims.

On Fox News’s Sunday morning talk show, Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich, not Russia, was responsible for the DNC hack. “It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians,” he said. “It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.”

On Monday, Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag “#SethRich” which fanned the flames even further: “WikiLeaks has never disclosed a source. Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. #SethRich.”

And on Tuesday, New Zealand file-sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering, claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014, and that the two had talked about “a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.”

“I know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak,” Dotcom wrote in a statement.

Rich’s family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors. “Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel,” Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday evening.

“Imagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death,” they wrote. “That nightmare is what our family goes through every day.”

The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks, and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked:

Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.
But to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered. Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive.",life seth rich year old democratic national

2576,"In January, a group of Cornell University undergraduates travelled to the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, a region of the world considered to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change. There they met with farmers, climate experts, government officials and their peers and learned about the ominous changes taking place in the Mekong that, ultimately, will impact us all.

The trip was part of course intended to help millennials better appreciate the interconnected and interdependent world they live in and to fully grasp what is ahead for Vietnam and for them – a grand challenge, on a grand scale. About the time these students turn 50, sea-level rise will have displaced an estimated million residents of the Mekong Delta.


By 2100 much of the region will likely be underwater, affecting millions more. To say nothing about the impacts on major American cities, including Miami Beach, Boston and New York that, like the Mekong, have considerable real estate at risk from rising sea levels.


Changes caused by rising sea levels are already flooding into the Mekong Delta, especially in the rural areas where Vietnam grows much of its food. Our group of Cornell students learned that rains now fall during what was once the dry season, interfering with seed set and reducing rice yields.

Increasing salt-water intrusion is forcing farmers to abandon rice altogether and switch to more salt-tolerant options such as shrimp production and crops such as coconut and watermelons. More groundwater is being used to dilute salty water for irrigation and drinking, which in turn results in land subsidence and exacerbated saltwater intrusion.

From this two-week journey to a country 8,000 miles from home and at the forefront of our greatest global challenge, the students gathered stories to tell and share with the world – because what is happening in Vietnam will be repeated globally.

One of the first things the students learned was that climate change is accepted as fact in Vietnam; it is not politicized, and is discussed freely. Messages to take home, “The Vietnamese people do not avoid talking about the changing climate; it’s happening in their own backyard,” said Conor McCabe, an animal science major, class of ‘18. “Climate change is definitely an uncomfortable topic since it has so many ramifications for society and the livelihoods of everyday people. Taking part in that difficult discussion, rather than shying away, is what I plan to do from now on,” said Becky Cardinali, an economics major, class of ’19.

These millennials also learned that despite the history of the Vietnam War and the role the U.S. now plays in exacerbating climate change, the Vietnamese people were extraordinarily welcoming: “I felt so embarrassed that I had contributed to the climate change that was destroying their livelihoods. How did they repay me?  By inviting me into their homes for tea. They did not hate us, in fact they were extremely welcoming, hopeful and forward looking,” said Marc Alessi an up-and-coming meteorologist, class of ‘18.

One of the more salient moments during their visit occurred when students heard a Vietnamese government official explain that the evidence for climate change and its cause is well established, and for them, it is not a hoax. As the students observed, climate change is not a hoax for the rest of the world, nor is it a distant, future threat: “My time in the Mekong Delta served as a reminder that, for many, climate change is immediate,” said Gail Fletcher, majoring in history and government, class of ’17.

In 2016 the United States and Vietnam, along with nearly every other country on the planet, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change committing them all to a goal of keeping temperature rise to below 20C, maybe 1.5. Eerily, the Peace Accords that ended the longest war in American history were also signed in Paris. A war that cost the lives of 58,000 U.S. troops, many the same age as today’s Cornell students.

“Setting all other issues aside, the Paris Agreement must be backed by all signatories. The bond that can heal troubled relationships between countries can be a shared concern for the future of this planet.

Otherwise, as Earth continues to warm and food becomes more scarce, driving up prices, tensions among countries are only going to rise and result in more conflict, more wars. Regardless of your personal, religious or cultural beliefs, the Earth is going to keep on warming. And it is already happening in real life and is impacting real people. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 2017: time to wake up,” added Jeff Fralick, environmental science and sustainability major, class of ’18.

Climate change is not a hoax to these millennials, members of one of the largest voter-eligible blocks in the U.S. — nearly 1 in 3. It is deadly serious and an issue that just might arouse this sleeping giant. It is their future and yours.",january group cornell university undergraduate travelled mekong river delta vietnam region world considered one vulnerable climate change met farmer climate expert government official peer learned ominous change taking place mekong ultimately impact u trip part course intended help millennials better appreciate interconnected interdependent world live fully grasp ahead vietnam grand challenge grand scale time student turn sea level rise displaced estimated million resident mekong delta much region likely underwater affecting million say nothing impact major american city including miami beach boston new york like mekong considerable real estate risk rising sea level change caused rising sea level already flooding mekong delta especially rural area vietnam grows much food group cornell student learned rain fall dry season interfering seed set reducing rice yield increasing salt water intrusion forcing farmer abandon rice altogether switch salt tolerant option shrimp production crop coconut watermelon groundwater used dilute salty water irrigation drinking turn result land subsidence exacerbated saltwater intrusion two week journey country mile home forefront greatest global challenge student gathered story tell share world happening vietnam repeated globally one first thing student learned climate change accepted fact vietnam politicized discussed freely message take home vietnamese people avoid talking changing climate happening backyard said conor mccabe animal science major class climate change definitely uncomfortable topic since many ramification society livelihood everyday people taking part difficult discussion rather shying away plan said becky cardinali economics major class millennials also learned despite history vietnam war role u play exacerbating climate change vietnamese people extraordinarily welcoming felt embarrassed contributed climate change destroying livelihood repay inviting home tea hate u fact extremely welcoming hopeful forward looking said marc alessi coming meteorologist class one salient moment visit occurred student heard vietnamese government official explain evidence climate change cause well established hoax student observed climate change hoax rest world distant future threat time mekong delta served reminder many climate change immediate said gail fletcher majoring history government class united state vietnam along nearly every country planet signed paris agreement climate change committing goal keeping temperature rise c maybe eerily peace accord ended longest war american history also signed paris war cost life u troop many age today cornell student setting issue aside paris agreement must backed signatory bond heal troubled relationship country shared concern future planet otherwise earth continues warm food becomes scarce driving price tension among country going rise result conflict war regardless personal religious cultural belief earth going keep warming already happening real life impacting real people lady gentleman time wake added jeff fralick environmental science sustainability major class climate change hoax millennials member one largest voter eligible block u nearly deadly serious issue might arouse sleeping giant future,cornell university undergraduate travelled mekong river delta vietnam region world considered one vulnerable climate change met farmer climate expert government official peer learned ominous change taking place mekong ultimately impact u trip part course intended help millennials better appreciate interconnected interdependent world live fully grasp ahead vietnam grand challenge grand scale time student turn sea level rise displaced estimated million resident mekong delta much region likely underwater affecting million say nothing impact major american city including miami beach boston new york like mekong considerable real estate
2577,"The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple.

The story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered ‘carbonic acid’ – today known as carbon dioxide – was one of a number of “perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours” to absorb radiant heat.

He also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be “held fast in the iron grip of frost”.

About 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up, particularly in the Arctic. But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise.

This is one of the certainties in climate science – the world has got warmer.

How do we know that the world has really warmed up?

Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990.

In addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows, sea levels rising by 20cm, islands disappearing, animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier.

Ironically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage – which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China – is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming.

It is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this. Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally.

As Nasa puts it: “There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.”

How do we know that warming has anything to do with humans?

All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.

But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.

Outside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and some of the ruling US politicians, no one disputes the above is true. Even the UK’s leading ‘sceptic’ think tank, Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees.

What will happen in the future?

Some commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a so-called ‘lukewarmist’ position, arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels. They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air.

Others have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory near the poles.

Both groups are at odds with the science.

As Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society, the ‘scientific consensus’ on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes.

According to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million – a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s – to more than 400ppm today.

“When we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it’s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it’s not individual predictions,” Professor Palmer told the Royal Society.

But, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly ‘dangerous’.

And, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also “a non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic”.

Models are often the source of derision from climate ‘sceptics’ or ‘deniers’, but they have actually proved remarkably successful when measured against actual observations.

2578,"With Hurricane Matthew wreaking havoc, the Left is predictably seizing the storm as a means of promoting their radical global warming agenda. Climate change has not been a major theme this election cycle, but Hillary Clinton is now trying to turn it into one, with the help of global warming guru Al Gore. Unfortunately for the climate change alarmists, despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric, the facts keep getting in the way. Here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax.

1. The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated. In 2009, the public discovered emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.

One of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the ""father"" or ""grandfather"" of the climate change myth, as it was his ""Model Zero"" that first introduced the concept of global warming. Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al. were all involved in trying ""to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming,"" according to the leaked emails. The emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the ""background data on which their findings and temperature records were based,"" even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data. They would engage in efforts to smear ""any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work.""

2. The Climategate scandal was given new life in 2011, with the release of new emails. The new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of 2009. Here are a couple of egregious emails from Jones found, via Forbes:

“I’ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts. One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process,” writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email.

“Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden,” Jones writes in another newly released email. “I’ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.”

An email written by Mann showed that he tried to get ""an investigative journalist to investigate and expose"" a climate skeptic scientist named Steven McIntyre.

3. NASA may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change. The Washington Times reported in 2009: ""Under pressure in 2007, NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934, not 1998, was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states. NASA later changed that data again, and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first, with 1934 slightly cooler.""

Since this occurred at around the same time as the Climategate scandal, Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to get NASA to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from NASA that revealed a disturbing fact: the agency admitted ""that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit,"" reported Fox News in 2010 – meaning NASA climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets.

A 2015 Washington Times editorial also highlighted another example of NASA cooking the books:

Paul Homewood, a skeptical researcher, found that in Paraguay, temperature readings for the 20th century at all nine weather stations supervised by NASA had been “adjusted” to transform a cooling trend into a warming trend. His analysis of readings in the Arctic found that rapid warming between 1920 and 1950 — before human activity could have increased the production of greenhouse gases — were adjusted downward so that the 1980s and ‘90s temperatures would stand out as warmer.

4. NASA also declared 2014 to be the hottest year on record – despite the fact that they were only 38 percent sure about it. The latter fact was left out of their press release at the time, as well as the fact that 2014 was supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year, 2010, by 0.02C – well within the margin of error of 0.1C that scientists tend to adhere by. The Washington Post attempted to spin in favor of NASA by arguing that NASA simply said that 2014 was the most likely hottest year on record – but their press release unequivocally stated that ""2014 was the warmest year on record"" and leaving out the aforementioned key facts makes such a declaration seem misleading, as it's clearly not a guarantee that 2014 was even likely the hottest year on record.

5. There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years. As The Daily Caller highlights, a recent peer-reviewed study concluded that when accounting for El Ninos and La Ninas – which are the ""the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific"" that ""occur on average every two to seven years,"" according to NOAA – there has been a flat-line temperature trend since 1997. In fact, the study found that the El Ninos and La Ninas disproved the existence of the Tropical Hot Spot, which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed as evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warming the atmosphere.

6. The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change. It's likely closer to 43 percent. The 97 percent myth stems from a variety of flawed studies, as the Daily Wire explained here. On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus.

7. The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high. Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the ""average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade,"" according to Paul Homewood. This runs directly counter to the predictions of the climate change models.

8. Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists.  Climate change alarmism is an extremely lucrative industry. All in all, there have been over $32.5 billion of federal government grants that have funded climate change research from 1989-2009, far more than any research funded by the oil industry. National Review reports:

Last summer, a minority staff report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works gave details on a “Billionaire’s Club” — a shadowy network of charitable foundations that distribute billions to advance climate alarmism. Shadowy nonprofits such as the Energy Foundation and Tides Foundation distributed billions to far-left green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which in turn send staff to the EPA who then direct federal grants back to the same green groups. It is incestuous. It is opaque. Major media ignored the report.

Mann, one of the scientists mentioned earlier for his role in the Climategate scandal, received nearly $6 million in grants from the federal government. The sources of funding for scientists like Hansen are unknown, the federal government has been resisting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to reveal them.

9. It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change. Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but because as Marco Morano points out at Climate Depot, ""The data show for the last 10 years we have had an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher) on the continental U.S.""

""That’s right, no major hurricanes have made landfall for over a decade,"" Morano continued. ""This is the longest such drought on record.""",hurricane matthew wreaking havoc left predictably seizing storm mean promoting radical global warming agenda climate change major theme election cycle

2579,"One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn’t exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers.

Researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys and found the so-called “tropical hotspot” relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant “simply does not exist in the real world.”

They found that once El Ninos are taken into account, “there is no ‘record setting’ warming to be concerned about.”

“These analysis results would appear to leave very, very little doubt but that EPA’s claim of a Tropical Hot Spot (THS), caused by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, simply does not exist in the real world,” reads the report by economist James Wallace, climatologist John Christy and meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo.

“Also critically important, even on an all-other-things-equal basis, this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series analyzed,” they wrote.

When EPA released its CO2 endangerment finding in 2009, it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming.
The crux of EPA’s argument rested on the existence of a “tropical hotspot” where global warming would be most apparent. That is, there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere — the “fingerprint” of global warming.

EPA’s endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan (CPP) now being fought over in federal court. CPP aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030 and could cost $41 billion a year, according to independent estimates.

D’Aleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for El Ninos and La Ninas. What they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for, there’s no warming trend.

“El Nino is not by any means new,” D’Aleo told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The El Ninos and La Ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper.”

Tropospheric temperatures are mainly measured by satellites and weather balloons, which collect data from the lowest few miles of the atmosphere. Satellites already show only slight warming since 1979, but they are sensitive to El Ninos and La Ninas.

Removing El Ninos and La Ninas from tropospheric temperatures creates “temperature time series each having a flat trend.” Basically, D’Aleo and his colleagues found oceanic warming events are responsible for virtually all the warming since 1977 when El Ninos became more frequent and stronger.

On the flip side, the recent “hiatus” in global warming can be explained by more frequent La Ninas, according to D’Aleo.

“It is an accepted fact that El Ninos bring global warmth and La Ninas cooling,” D’Aleo said. “It is thus not at all surprising that the period from 1947 to 1977 brought cooling, 1977 to 1997 warming and we had a flat trend from 1997 to current.”

With El Ninos and La Ninas adjusted out of the data, only volcanoes are left — base on EPA assumptions — to impact the climate, and D’Aleo’s report acknowledges “it was still possible that the volcanic activity was hiding CO2’s impact.”

Volcanic aerosols can have a cooling effect on global average temperature; the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo caused a dip in satellite temperature data that lasted for a couple years.

“The temperature data measurements that were analyzed were taken by many different entities using balloons, satellites, buoys and various land based techniques,” reads the report. “Needless to say, if regardless of data source, the results are the same, the analysis findings should be considered highly credible.”

Climate scientists have been debating for years over the existence of the “tropical hotspot.”

Christy, who co-runs the premier satellite temperature dataset at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with climatologist Roy Spencer, has presented evidence that climate models overpredicted warming in the tropical troposphere.

Ross McKitrick, an environmental economist at the University of Guelph in Canada, also ran the numbers and found climate models overestimated warming in the tropical troposphere.

McKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos — just like D’Aleo, Christy and Williams found.

“Over the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,” McKitrick wrote in a 2014 study.",one main line evidence used obama administration justify global warming regulation exist real world according new report climate researcher researcher analyzed temperature observation satellite weather balloon weather station buoy found called tropical hotspot relied upon epa declare carbon dioxide pollutant simply exist real world found el ninos taken account record setting warming concerned analysis result would appear leave little doubt epa claim tropical hot spot th caused rising atmospheric co level simply exist real world read report economist james wallace climatologist john christy meteorologist joseph aleo also critically important even thing equal basis analysis failed find steadily rising atmospheric co concentration statistically significant impact critically important temperature time series analyzed wrote epa released co endangerment finding used three line evidence bolster argument greenhouse gas threatened human health global warming crux epa argument rested existence tropical hotspot global warming would apparent enhanced warming tropical troposphere fingerprint global warming epa endangerment finding legal basis agency global warming regulation including clean power plan cpp fought federal court cpp aim cut power plant carbon dioxide emission percent could cost billion year according independent estimate aleo colleague looked data controlled el ninos la nina found natural oceanic warming cooling event accounted warming trend el nino mean new aleo told daily caller news foundation el ninos la nina occur regular frequency tend cluster showed paper tropospheric temperature mainly measured satellite weather balloon collect data lowest mile atmosphere satellite already show slight warming since sensitive el ninos la nina removing el ninos la nina tropospheric temperature creates temperature time series flat trend basically aleo colleague found oceanic warming event responsible virtually warming since el ninos became frequent stronger flip side recent hiatus global warming explained frequent la nina according aleo accepted fact el ninos bring global warmth la nina cooling aleo said thus surprising period brought cooling warming flat trend current el ninos la nina adjusted data volcano left base epa assumption impact climate aleo report acknowledges still possible volcanic activity hiding co impact volcanic aerosol cooling effect global average temperature eruption mt pinatubo caused dip satellite temperature data lasted couple year temperature data measurement analyzed taken many different entity using balloon satellite buoy various land based technique read report needle say regardless data source result analysis finding considered highly credible climate scientist debating year existence tropical hotspot christy co run premier satellite temperature dataset university alabama huntsville climatologist roy spencer presented evidence climate model overpredicted warming tropical troposphere ross mckitrick environmental economist university guelph canada also ran number found climate model overestimated warming tropical troposphere mckitrick provided evidence phase shift dominant el nina el ninos like aleo christy williams found year climate model significantly predict observed warming tropical troposphere represent fundamentally different way observed mckitrick wrote study,epa claim tropical hot spot th caused rising atmospheric co level simply exist real world read report economist james wallace climatologist john christy meteorologist joseph aleo also critically important even thing equal basis analysis failed find steadily rising atmospheric co concentration statistically significant impact critically important temperature time series analyzed .
2580,"Climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world – a $1.5 trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer, every cent, penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people, none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding, all of it a complete and utter waste.

Nowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which, I sincerely believe – and I’ve been doing a lot of research into this – must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world.

Last year Climate Change Business Journal – calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year.

All those carbon traders, climate researchers, renewables and biofuels experts, environment correspondents, professors of climate science at the University of East Anglia and the Potsdam Institute, sustainability officers on local councils, and so on, add up the cost of their grants and salaries – and $1.5 trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach.

So what does $1.5 trillion look like in a global economic context?

Well, it’s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry.

$1.5 trillion on the global warming industry; $1.5 trillion on the online shopping industry.

But there’s a key difference between these two industries.

One exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want – to their mutual benefit; the other is a sham.

Buying stuff on the internet: it’s really useful, isn’t it? It has had a dramatically transforming effect on our quality of life, the way you can order a book at 11 o’clock on a Sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day.

But how did this marvellous industry spring up? Was it because of all the special incentives and tax breaks granted by wise governments? Nope of course not. They weren’t necessary. The online shopping industry sprung up and grew and grew because it was what people wanted, where they chose – of their own volition – to spend their money.

Now compare and contrast the global warming industry – which I call a Potemkin industry – because that’s what it is: a fraud; a sham; a conspiracy against the taxpayer.

Do you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren’t for all the money funnelled into it via government grants and taxpayer levies and subsidies and regulatory capture?

Pretty close to zero, I’d say. Take wind farms – my hobby horse. The cost of intermittent, unreliable wind energy is roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind; three times the market rate for onshore. Nobody’s going to pay that kind of money in the open market. The only way it’s going to happen if people are mandated by the government to do so: which is what of course has happened across Europe and in the US.

Warren Buffett has said it: “wind farms don’t make sense without the tax credit.”

They’re inefficient; they kill birds and bats; they spoil views; they’re environmentally unfriendly – rare earth minerals from China; they’re hazardous; they’re expensive; they’re ugly (well I think they are….)

And in few countries is the damage these monstrosities have done more obvious than in Germany, home of the hateful Energiewende.

Energiewende means Energy Transition. It has been a disaster, as Rupert Darwall noted in a recent Telegraph article.

In 2004, the Green energy minister, Jürgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around €1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently €21.8bn a year; €20bn is being spent on a new north-south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number.

They cause real people real misery.

In 2013, 345,000 German households could not pay their electricity bills because Energiewende had made them so expensive.

That’s the financial damage they’ve caused. What about the environmental damage? Here we are in Germany, the Greenest nation on earth. Aren’t Greens supposed to care about animals? Well they don’t about bats, clearly.

Bats are special. The reason they’re so heavily protected by so many laws is that they are a K-selected species. That is, they reproduce very slowly, live a long time and are easy to wipe out. Having evolved with few predators – flying at night helps – bats did very well with this strategy until the modern world.

But now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away. This would suggest that German turbines – which one study claims kill more than 200,000 bats a year – may be depressing populations across the entire northeastern portion of Europe.

Why would anyone put up such things. One reason and one reason only: follow the money.

Where does the money come from? Us!

Who made the decision to spend that money? Not us.

Oh definitely not us. Had it been us we might have done a bit of basic due diligence.

Like, OK, so these wind turbines are necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man-made global warming?

Correct.

So has the planet ever been as warm in human history as it is today?

Well, only in the Minoan warming period and the Roman warming period and the Medieval warming period.

Just those. Right. And presumably back then all that CO2 heavy industry was burning was a real problem? No just kidding…Out of interest how much has the planet warmed in the last few years?

About 0.8 degrees C since 1850.

Right so since the end of the Little Ice Age (so called because it was characterised by unpleasant cold) and years like the infamous Year Without A Summer (1816), the planet has heated by less than the temperature increase you’d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid-morning coffee time?

Ah yes but the computer models…

Indeed the computer models. Those amazing models which have been predicting catastrophic, runaway warming, when there has been no significant warming since 1998 – so for eighteen years there has been no global warming?

Ah yes but the temperatures of February 2016….

Look I could go on like this forever. I’ve been listening to these increasingly desperate excuses for decades. Perhaps some of you here believe them – if so, there’s a bridge I’d like to sell you…

But it really doesn’t matter whether you believe in global warming or not because here’s the reality:

All that money we’re being to spend on the global warming industry – that $1.5 trillion I mentioned earlier siphoned straight out of taxpayers’ pockets – it isn’t going to make the blindest bit of difference.

No, I exaggerate. It will make a teeny weeny bit of difference. Bjorn Lomborg has done the calculations. You’re going to love this, if you haven’t heard this before. These figures are just amazing.

So recently you’ll recall there was a big UN climate conference in Paris COP 21 and all the leaders of the world flew in to save the planet from global warming. But before they turned up, each delegate nation made a voluntary agreement as to how much it was going to cut its carbon emissions. Not compulsory, note. So these countries are free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction targets – as funnily enough South Korea did last week. This is how much – best case scenario – that various countries are prepared to do to combat climate change.

So Lomborg added up all the countries INDCs – that stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions – and worked out, using the climate alarmists’ own models, what effect all this would have on global temperature.

Do you want to know how much? (Oh this is the optimistic scenario by the way, not the pessimistic one).

If all the countries do their bit then the total reduction in global warming – by the year 2100 will be 0.170 degrees Centigrade.

As a climate sceptic friend of mine pointed out at the time, you’d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walking down from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel tower.

So there’s your deal folks: you – and taxpayers like you – are paying $1.5 trillion a year to reduce the world’s temperatures by the end of this century by 0.170.

It’s so perfectly ridiculous it’s almost funny.

And I suppose on a personal level I shouldn’t complain. I call climate change “the gift that goes on giving” because day in day out I get an endless stream of stories to write about the corruption, incompetence, skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry.

But, putting my career aside for the moment, is this really a world we’d like to live in? Can it be right that people who have worked hard for their money should have it taken from them and then wasted in so spectacular fashion?

And it’s not just the waste that’s so bad it’s worse than that.

If it were simply a form of taxpayer-funded welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental sciences graduates that would be one thing.

But this is causing real, lasting harm in any number of ways.

The corrupting effects on science – and the scientific method – which at times are almost redolent of Lysenkoism of the Stalin era.

The brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers.

The economic damage caused by the misallocation of resources, as so frequently happens in Communist countries

The pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it’s supposedly more CO2-friendly) which calls to mind Chernobyl or the poisoning of the Aral Sea.

The human suffering of those 345,000 German households I mentioned who can’t pay their electricity bills.

Does this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything?

Well it has often been said – and there is much anecdotal evidence to support this – that after the Berlin Wall came down the left had a bit of a problem. Capitalism had won the economic argument. Where could the left go next?

But the solution was there waiting them – the green movement. In the guise of saving the world’s environment they could advance all their usual obsessions – control, regulation, state intervention, puritanism, compulsory immiseration – though this time with a smiling, fluffy face. Watermelons they call them: green on the outside, red on the inside.

So the Berlin Wall came down but it never really went away.

2581,"Yet more bad news for Obamacare this week: Molina Healthcare lost $110 million on the exchanges last year, and the CEO told investors, “There are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017.”

At first glance, it’s hard to see why this piece of news is worth worrying about. UnitedHealth recently projected several times those losses, and it's a bigger player on the exchanges. Why spend so much time looking at one modest-size insurer?

Because Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed to, by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business, as one of the “bright spots” on the exchanges. Molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people. Before Obamacare, they were a sizable player in the “Medicaid managed care” model, and it seemed like the expertise they’d thusly acquired was allowing them to design the sort of plans that actually made money on the exchanges. Which is to say bare bones plans, not fancy but adequate. Apparently, that’s no longer a money-maker, at least for Molina.

This isn’t necessarily the pattern we’ve seen with other insurers. Molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool, to those who got stuck with the sicker patients. Those losses were partially offset by lower medical costs than they expected, which is certainly good news. But it’s not great news. Lower-than-expected costs can be from the system working well, or they can simply come from the fact that you happened to get a healthier insurance pool. If the government makes you give the latter gains back, and more, then you’re still not going to be profitable. And insurers that aren’t profitable over the long term aren’t going to stick around.
Nor can you fix the problem by adjusting the transfer fund. Those losses are occurring somewhere in the market; someone has to pay for the care. If you got rid of Obamacare’s risk transfer provisions, those insurers would lose more money, and exit the market, and the patients would end up with some other insurer. Who would then lose a bunch of money on them. Unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate, the exchanges are not going to stabilize.

Molina’s losses suggest that instead of stabilizing, the exchanges are getting worse. There is no way to fix Obamacare without fixing the pool so that younger, healthier people buy insurance.

Democrats had six years to come up with a way to do that (or perhaps I should say, a way to do that that could actually get through Congress without hordes of angry voters burning their representatives in effigy). They failed. Now Republicans are taking their shot, and so far at least, they don’t seem any more on target than Democrats were.

2582,"Congressional Republicans, evidently hoping that by repeating an untruth they’ll convince American voters, and perhaps themselves, that it’s a truth, on Wednesday said the Affordable Care Act has “failed.”

The undistilled version of this view came from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who emerged Wednesday from a meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence to assert: “This law has failed. Americans are struggling. The law is failing while we speak. … Things are only getting worse under Obamacare. … The healthcare system has been ruined — dismantled — under Obamacare.”

Every one of those statements is demonstrably untrue. How do we know this? We know because every measure of healthcare spending, access and cost has improved since the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Timothy McBride of Washington University in St. Louis has done the heavy lifting of pulling together the relevant charts and graphs, and posting them online in a series of 12 tweets compiled on Storify. We’ve culled some of the most important, and present them here.

We should add, first, that Ryan also pledged, once the GOP repeals the law, to “make sure that there is a stable transition to a truly patient-centered system. We want every American to have access to quality, affordable health coverage”

This is nothing but fatuous gobbledygook. The GOP has had six years to come up with an alternative plan, and never has done so. Its current strategy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, and then cook up a replacement sometime in the next two, three, even four years. (They can’t even agree on a time frame.) What exactly is a “patient-centered system,” anyway?

Here are the charts, courtesy of professor McBride.

First, the overall uninsured rate has come sharply down since the advent of Obamacare:
The uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell from nearly 16% in 2010 to less than 10%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's now at a historic low.
The decline in uninsured rates was especially pronounced among lower-income Americans, according to the Council of Economic Advisors and other sources:

Uninsured rates fell by more than 10 percentage points among the poorest Americans eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act — those earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line.
Although Republicans claim that even if the Affordable Care Act brought down the uninsured rate, its enrollees had trouble seeing a doctor, that isn’t true. Numerous studies debunk claims that doctors shun Affordable Care Act enrollees. This sample by the Council of Economic Advisors shows that the decline in the uninsured rate is closely associated with a reduction in people who were prevented from seeking and finding medical care because of its cost:

Hospitals are major beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act, as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Council of Economic Advisors report. Hospitals’ uncompensated care costs fell sharply in Medicaid expansion states, as patients treated as indigent in the past are now covered by Medicaid. Their uncompensated care costs fell from an average 4% of operating costs before the Affordable Care Act to less than 2% afterward, a decline worth tens of billions of dollars nationwide.

Overall national health spending has come down even faster than was predicted, as a share of gross domestic product:


The average growth in per-enrollee spending by private health plans in key categories has slowed materially since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, from annual growth averaging 5% in 2000-2010, to 1.5% in 2010-2015. Spending growth on hospital services, physician services and prescription drugs all slowed. Medicare, which has instituted numerous cost-control initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, has seen an overall decline in spending per enrollee.

Finally, even though employer-based insurance hasn’t yet been directly affected by the Affordable Care Act, there seems to be a spillover effect from the overall reduction in healthcare spending growth. Premiums rose by an average 5.6% a year in the 10 years prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act, but only 3.1% since, according to Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual survey of employer health benefits.


Republicans have promised to give Americans a health insurance system better than the Affordable Care Act’s and at lower cost. This is almost surely a chimera; no plan that the GOP has considered would expand coverage beyond the Affordable Care Act. To the extent that the plans would reduce costs, they would do so by relieving the federal government of responsibility for paying for coverage and placing it even more heavily on the shoulders of individuals and families. That’s not lowering costs; it’s just shifting them to those least able to pay. The fact that the GOP will have to face is that bringing healthcare to more Americans costs money. Taking it away from millions of Americans will cost money, too.

No one claimed, either before the passage of the Affordable Care Act or afterward, that it was perfect or that it would solve America’s healthcare crisis in one swipe. What became evident in the three years since the individual insurance exchanges opened for business (on Jan. 1, 2014) is that the subsidies for premiums needed to be increased and improved. Because they’re inadequate, especially as households cross the threshold of 400% of the federal poverty line at which subsidies are eliminated — at about $97,200 for a family of four — middle-class families in the individual insurance market feel overburdened. They blame Obamacare for this injustice. The real culprits are Republicans who have refused to consider any approach to the Affordable Care Act except repeal. Now the GOP is “it” on healthcare, and it’s discovering that crafting a solution from scratch may be almost impossible.

What became evident during the most recent open-enrollment period for Obamacare exchanges is that “Obamacare is more popular than ever,” as Kevin Drum of Mother Jones observes. Enrollment grew to 12 million, up by about 1 million from 2015, even in the face of higher premiums. In any case, more than 85% of all enrollees are entitled to subsidies, which limits and in some cases cancels out the higher prices.

Yet the GOP pledges to overturn all that.

2583,"Did Obamacare work?

It’s worth reflecting upon after President Trump and House Republicans failed on Friday to repeal and replace the “disaster” of Obamacare.

Ever since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate. But by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care, it’s possible to hazard some judgments.

The answer may vary with your own experience, but it ultimately depends on what you value. For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more Americans, the rational answer should be: Yes, Obamacare succeeded. More than 20 million Americans gained health coverage through the law.

Continue reading the main story
For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it, the rational answer is: No, Obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability. Health care in the United States remains the most expensive in the world, and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many Americans.

For those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make Americans healthier, the answer has to be: It is too soon to tell.

One thing is clear, though — the Affordable Care Act has shifted the nation’s baseline expectations for how health care should work. Its successes have pushed Republican politicians, like Mr. Trump, into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all Americans. Its failures have become focal points, too, leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals.

Since Republicans took power, public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor. For lots of people, “Obamacare” has become synonymous with the health care system itself, with its many miracles and dysfunctions.

There are layers beneath each judgment, of course. The law was broad and complex, with many goals and provisions. This assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments. For many important questions, there is not yet strong evidence either way.

Successes:

Twenty million more people have health insurance.

Providing health coverage to the uninsured was Obamacare’s principal goal, and on that measure, it has succeeded. The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher.

Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an “individual mandate” to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.

The rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn’t get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.

It has made many Americans more financially secure.

Health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law’s full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.
It has reduced inequality.

In an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration’s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.

It made health insurance more comprehensive.

Before Obamacare, many products could be called “health insurance.” Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can’t cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law’s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients’ access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.

It lowered the federal deficit.

Obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law’s tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)

Failures:

Health insurance remains very expensive.

Obamacare’s marketplaces and Medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line, but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums, and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan. In the law’s first three years, premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly. But prices shot up this year, causing financial shocks for buyers who don’t receive government help in paying their premiums. Several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and too-low early pricing and may represent a one-time market correction. Insurers have also said that they have found the pool of Obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected. Some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable.

The health care system remains complex and confusing.

President Barack Obama has described the health law’s markets as being like a Kayak or an Amazon for health insurance. They’re not. Health insurance is easier to shop for now, but it remains a complicated and opaque product, and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for Americans unsure of their health needs — or unable to decode jargon like “out-of-pocket maximum” or “in-network provider.” After picking their insurance, patients can still struggle to use it, and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies.

In many parts of the country, only one insurer even offers health plans, limiting the choices available to consumers.

If you like your plan, you can’t always keep your plan. ...

The Obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases. The markets have also been turbulent, with insurers going out of business, exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year. That has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year, unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it.

… Or your doctor.

Many Obamacare health plans, trying to keep prices competitive, have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover. Obamacare’s authors did not expect so-called narrow network plans to become so widespread. These have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers, and means that switching plans often means switching doctors, too. The narrower networks, despite their inconveniences, have helped keep insurance prices lower.

Too Soon to Tell:

We don’t know if the law made America healthier.

Health insurance is not the same thing as health, and we still have very limited data about whether the law’s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways. There is some encouraging but very early evidence that low-income people in two states that expanded Medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their low-income neighbors in a state that did not. And there is research that more low-income Americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services, including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes.

But it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health, or how large that effect may be. Even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage, that’s a small fraction of the nation’s population, and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits.

It’s unclear what the law has done to national health spending.

A crucial goal for Mr. Obama was “bending the cost curve” and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the United States. Growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since Obamacare’s passage, but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending, including the Great Recession, rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies. The health law’s most ardent champions, including Mr. Obama, credit it for this change. But many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence.

It may have improved the quality of care in hospitals.

The health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidence-based. The health system is still often a dangerous place for patients, but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital, for example, or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks. Some trends were underway before the health law passed, so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by Obamacare or would have happened anyway.",obamacare work worth reflecting upon

2584,"Millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. That’s not what this week’s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says, but it is reality. CBO’s estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world, the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis, millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. But for CBO, Obamacare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if Obamacare is left in place. To hit that mark, 2 million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last. That seems unlikely. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates that 27.9 million people under age 65 lacked coverage as of September 30 last year, the most recent date for which government survey data are available. That represents little improvement over its estimate of 28.4 million as of December 2015, meaning that the number of non-elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year. Since then, the Obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode. Fewer people signed up during the open-enrollment period this year than last, due in part to premium hikes that averaged 25 percent. Other insurance companies didn’t bother raising prices; they fled the exchanges. By January, 1,000 counties were down to their last insurer. Five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges. A rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom. Not CBO. Its analysts believe that Obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle. The number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in 2018, according to CBO, even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges. That improbably happy outcome would change, the agency says, if Congress were to enact its repeal bill. In that case, CBO warns, the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by 4 million. That includes 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses. Ditto for 1 million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job-based coverage. CBO believes that these 4 million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after Congress repeals the tax on the uninsured. That number will rise to 14 million next year, according to CBO. That includes 5 million who will abandon Medicaid, 2 million who will drop their employer-sponsored coverage, and 6 million who will leave the exchanges. These 14 million people will not, despite what you’ve read, “lose coverage.” For the most part, CBO says, they “will choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties” [emphasis added]. The GOP bill not only retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019, it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing Obamacare exchanges. But that spending, according to CBO, won’t halt the stampede to the Obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate. CBO’s illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate don’t square with reality. The evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured. The IRS reports that in 2015, 6.5 million paid the penalty, 12.7 million obtained an exemption, while 4.3 million simply ignored it. That’s 23.5 million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the government’s threat of tax penalties. CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. Let’s do the math. NHIS estimates that 44.3 million non-elderly were uninsured in 2013, the year before Obamacare was fully implemented. If CBO is to be believed, the number of uninsured will increase by 14 million next year, joining another 23.5 million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it. That would mean that 85 percent of the uninsured (37.5 million out of 44.3 million) apparently would want nothing to do with Obamacare’s government-defined and subsidized benefits were Congress to repeal the individual mandate. If CBO is correct, the government will have spent $462 billion between 2014 and 2018 on subsidies and Medicaid expansions, only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from 44.3 million to 41 million. It is also possible that CBO is wrong about the individual mandate. That seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads aren’t buried in CBO’s faulty models. Some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage-interest deduction with a tax on the homeless. But does anyone believe that if a Republican Congress repealed that tax, homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates? CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law. In the face of considerable contrary evidence, they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage. They appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since 2014 are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies, despite feckless IRS enforcement. And they assume that even if Congress keeps the tax credits and Medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets, 14 million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured. Congress should set policy based on reality, not on CBO’s speculations. Obamacare exchanges are falling apart, Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace, and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable. The House and Senate should act now to stabilize those markets, repeal the law (including the individual mandate), and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care decision-making.

2585,"Come November, the grim trudge across the increasingly barren Obamacare landscape begins anew. Illinois consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies. Some types of plans could cost an average of 43 percent to 55 percent more. Ditto across the country: A first tranche of states approved 2017 rates with similarly cardiac-arrest-inducing premium increases.

Many Illinois consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers fled this market. UnitedHealthcare bolted. So did Aetna. Land of Lincoln Health collapsed mid-year, leaving policy holders to scramble for coverage that could cost them plenty. In many places across Illinois and the nation, people will find drastically fewer choices of plans than they did last year.

States struggling with Obamacare are undermining the law
The Affordable Care Act has been criticized since it was passed in 2010. Its success depended on states supporting their marketplaces and enrolling healthy consumers. Sept. 7, 2016.
Those insurers fled because they didn't want to lose more money on a government-run market that is so far out of whack — a market they think likely will never be profitable for them. That isn't surprising, as we enumerate below.

But by diagnosing Obamacare, all of us can see the mistakes that any repair or replacement can avoid. So let's look at the failings and how they can drive solutions:

Obamacare failed because it flunked Economics 101 and Human Nature 101. It straitjacketed insurers into providing overly expensive, soup-to-nuts policies. It wasn't flexible enough so that people could buy as much coverage as they wanted and could afford — not what the government dictated. Many healthy people primarily want catastrophic coverage. Obamacare couldn't lure them in, couldn't persuade them to buy on the chance they'd get sick.

Obamacare failed because the penalties for going uncovered are too low when stacked against its skyrocketing premium costs. Next year, the penalty for staying uninsured is $695 per adult, or perhaps 2.5 percent of a family's taxable household income. That's far less than many Americans would pay for coverage.

Obamacare failed because insurance is based on risk pools — that is, the lucky subsidize the unlucky. The unlucky who have big health problems (and big medical bills) reap much greater benefits than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors' office. But Obamacare's rules hamstring insurers. They can't exclude people for pre-existing conditions, and can't charge older customers more than three times as much as the young. Those are good goals, but they skew the market in ways Obamacare didn't figure out how to offset. Result: Young and healthy consumers pay far more in premiums than their claims (probably) would justify in order to subsidize the unexpectedly large influx of older, sicker customers who require expensive care. Too many unlucky people, too few lucky people: That will collapse any insurance scheme.

Obamacare failed because it allowed Americans to sign up after they got sick and needed help paying all those medical bills. Insurance should be structured so that, although you don't know if you'll need it, you pay for it anyway, just in case; your alternative is financial doom. But if you can game the system and, for example, buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage, then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand.

Obamacare failed because it hasn't tamed U.S. medical costs. Health care is about supply and demand: People who get coverage use it, especially if the law mandates free preventive care. Iron law of economics: Nothing is free; someone pays. To pretend otherwise was folly. Those forces combined to spike the costs of care, and thus insurance costs.

Obamacare failed because too many carriers simply can't cover expenses, let alone turn a profit, in this rigidly controlled system. Take Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state's dominant Obamacare insurer. Last year, for every dollar the carrier collected, it spent $1.32 buying care and providing services for customers, according to BCBS President Maurice Smith. No wonder BCBS is proposing rate increases from 23 percent to 45 percent for its individual plans.

A question looms: Is Obamacare plunging in a so-called insurance death spiral? Is the market so unstable that plans are doomed to get more and more expensive, driving more Americans and more insurers out of the market until ... Obamacare thuds to the pavement?

More Americans have health insurance, for now
We won't predict that, but neither do we see a mathematical alternative. What's clear is that the solutions to Obamacare are implicit in its failures. A repaired or replaced system has to be more flexible, letting insurers offer a wider range of plans so that consumers, not lawmakers or bureaucrats, dictate what's best for them. That system should protect those who carry continuous coverage, not coddle those who duck in and out of plans when their health needs change.

A new system also should scrap the job-killing Obamacare mandates that discourage companies from hiring and discourage workers from adding hours. Instead of gearing subsidies to incomes, let Americans not covered via an employer reap tax credits to help finance their insurance purchases on the open market. And tell us again: Why can't insurers sell policies across state lines? Imagine the pricing competition that would unleash.

We can deny the current system's failings, or we can parlay our evolving knowledge into something much better.

2586,"Remember how much Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare?

The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to repeal the law. Conservatives have twice brought challenges to the Supreme Court — a court with powerful voices that often lean in their direction — only to be largely rebuffed both times. The last government shutdown was driven by Republicans who insisted on defunding Obamacare (not to be confused with what may be the next government shutdown, driven by Republicans insisting on defunding Planned Parenthood).

Some suggest that the calls for repealing Obamacare are fading. Sarah Kliff argued that the “near-complete absence of Obama’s health overhaul” in last week’s Republican presidential debate was “remarkable.”

Maybe, but don’t count on it. In GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s white paper on how he would get to 4 percent growth through supply-side tax cuts, his team of economists stresses that repealing the Affordable Care Act will be an “important means of enhancing economic growth.” Front-runner Donald Trump said just last week that he was going to replace Obamacare with “DonaldCare,” which would be both “absolutely great” and “really spectacular.” Repealing health-care reform remains a prominent talking point for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz, both GOP presidential candidates.

Well, since we don’t know what’s in it, I can’t comment on DonaldCare.

But I can tell you this about Obamacare: When it comes to meeting one of its most important goals — providing coverage to the uninsured — it is working extremely well. It’s posting historical gains on this front and, in so doing, both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents.

The facts of the case are thoroughly drawn out in this new analysis by my colleagues Matt Broaddus and Edwin Park (B&P) from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:

— As the figure above shows, newly released census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from 13.3 percent to 10.4 last year.

— That’s the largest single-year drop on record based on data going back to 1987.

hi2
Source: B&P (see text)
— In this type of work, the strength of your findings are much bolstered when you see them across multiple sources. As B&P point out, the census findings are “consistent with the historic coverage gains measured in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey and several private surveys…at 9.2 percent, the CDC’s estimated uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2015 was the lowest since the CDC began collecting these data in 1997 and more than 40 percent below the peak in 2010.”

— The ACA takes a two-pronged attack on covering the uninsured, subsidizing private coverage through the exchanges and expanding Medicaid in the 25 states (as well as D.C.) that accepted that part of the deal. Both private and public coverage are making significant gains.

— Speaking of anti-Obamacare ideology and its effect on people, B&P provide this revealing calculation: “If the uninsured rate had fallen in non-expansion states at the same rate as in expansion states, an additional 2.6 million uninsured Americans would have gained coverage last year.”

— Coverage last year grew most quickly among households with income below $50,000; their uninsured rate fell from about 20 percent to about 15 percent — in one year! Households above $50,000 had lower uninsured rates to start with, so we would expect smaller changes, but they, too, went from 9 percent to 7.4 percent.

Such truths are more than inconvenient for sworn enemies of the law. They can bob and weave in their primaries, but once they reach the general election, their Democratic opponent will slam them on these points. And unless they’re willing to massively flip — pretty unimaginable, given the heat generated by the issue for conservatives — people represented in the numbers and charts above will rightfully fear that their health security is at stake.

I cannot overemphasize the importance of these facts, and, yes, I know better than most that our political discourse too often exists in a fact-free zone. But the success of the ACA strikes at the heart of the dysfunction strategy employed extremely effectively by anti-government conservatives. This is the self-fulfilling-prophecy strategy that campaigns on: “Washington is broken! Send me there and I’ll make sure it stays that way!”

Remember, when government messes up, when it shuts down, when it fails to address the things that matter to most people — economic opportunity, wage stagnation, affordable college — and, instead, squabbles about Planned Parenthood, the winners are those who can say: “See? We told you. Government’s broken!” Never mind that those making that case are the ones doing the breaking.

But with Obamacare, they’ve been failing, and the more we elevate that case, the closer we get to the road back to Factville.",remember much republican wanted repeal obamacare republican majority house representative voted time repeal law conservative twice brought challenge supreme court court powerful voice often lean direction largely rebuffed time last government shutdown driven republican insisted defunding obamacare confused may next government shutdown driven republican insisting defunding planned parenthood suggest call repealing obamacare fading sarah kliff argued near complete absence obama health overhaul last week republican presidential debate remarkable maybe count gop presidential candidate jeb bush white paper would get percent growth supply side tax cut team economist stress repealing affordable care act important mean enhancing economic growth front runner donald trump said last week going replace obamacare donaldcare would absolutely great really spectacular repealing health care reform remains prominent talking point wisconsin gov scott walker sen ted cruz gop presidential candidate well since know comment donaldcare tell obamacare come meeting one important goal providing coverage uninsured working extremely well posting historical gain front insulating repeal creating daunting political challenge opponent fact case thoroughly drawn new analysis colleague matt broaddus edwin park b p center budget policy priority figure show newly released census data show share without health coverage fell percent last year largest single year drop record based data going back hi source b p see text type work strength finding much bolstered see across multiple source b p point census finding consistent historic coverage gain measured center disease control cdc prevention national health interview survey several private survey percent cdc estimated uninsured rate first quarter lowest since cdc began collecting data percent peak aca take two pronged attack covering uninsured subsidizing private coverage exchange expanding medicaid state well c accepted part deal private public coverage making significant gain speaking anti obamacare ideology effect people b p provide revealing calculation uninsured rate fallen non expansion state rate expansion state additional million uninsured american would gained coverage last year coverage last year grew quickly among household income uninsured rate fell percent percent one year household lower uninsured rate start would expect smaller change went percent percent truth inconvenient sworn enemy law bob weave primary reach general election democratic opponent slam point unless willing massively flip pretty unimaginable given heat generated issue conservative people represented number chart rightfully fear health security stake overemphasize importance fact yes know better political discourse often exists fact free zone success aca strike heart dysfunction strategy employed extremely effectively anti government conservative self fulfilling prophecy strategy campaign washington broken send make sure stay way remember government mess shuts fails address thing matter people economic opportunity wage stagnation affordable college instead squabble planned parenthood winner say see told government broken never mind making case one breaking obamacare failing elevate case closer get road back factville,b p see text type work strength finding much bolstered see across multiple source b p point census finding consistent historic coverage gain measured center disease control cdc prevention national health interview survey several private survey percent cdc estimated uninsured rate first quarter lowest since cdc began collecting data percent peak aca take two pronged attack covering uninsured rate drop percent percent one year household lower uninsured rate start would expect smaller change went percent percent percent truth inconvenient
